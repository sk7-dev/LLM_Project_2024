HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE

DUMBLEDORE:
I should have known you'd be here, Professor McGonagall. The cat leaps forward, TRANSFIGURES itself into a rather severe-looking woman in an EMERALD CLOAK.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Are the rumors true, Albus?

DUMBLEDORE:
(smile fading) I'm afraid so. The good. And the bad.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
And the boy?

DUMBLEDORE:
Hagrid's bringing him.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
You think it...wise...to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

DUMBLEDORE:
I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor. A LOW RUMBLE disturbs the skies. Dumbledore and McGonagall look up and—suddenly—a HUGE MOTORCYCLE plummets through the clouds, hits the ground with a THUNDEROUS ROAR. As the SMOKE clears, a FIGURE climbs off. He is HAGRID and is, quite obviously, a GIANT. In his vast, muscular arms, he holds a BUNDLE of BLANKETS.

HAGRID:
Ev'ning, professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.

DUMBLEDORE:
No problems, I take it, Hagrid?

HAGRID:
No sir. Little tyke fell ter sleep as we was flyin' o'er Bristol. Hagrid steps forward and Dumbledore takes the bundle, turns toward the doorstep.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Albus, do you really think it best to leave him here, with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They're...

DUMBLEDORE:
The only family he has.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
But this boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name...

DUMBLEDORE:
Exactly. It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk. Famous for something he won't even remember. No. He'll be much better off growing up away from all that. Until he's ready. Dumbledore lays the bundle on the mat. Hagrid SNIFFLES.

DUMBLEDORE:
There, there, Hagrid. It's not eally goodbye, after all. Hagrid hods. Dumbledore tucks a PARCHMENT ENVELOPE into the blankets and steps back, his face suddenly dark. Serious.

DUMBLEDORE:
Good luck, Harry Potter. The CAMERA DOLLIES forward, toward the swaddled baby. A CUT, still fresh, gleams on the baby's forehead. It is in the shape of a BOLT of LIGHTNING. SMASH CUT TO TEN YEARS LATER.

AUNT PETUNIA:
There's the birthday boy! Don't you look smart for your trip to the zoo. (scowling at Harry) You mind the bacon. And don't dare let it burn. I want everything perfect on my Dimplin's special day.

HARRY:
Yes, Aunt Petunia.

UNCLE VERNON:
Bring my coffee, boy.

HARRY:
Yes, Uncle Vernon. Dudley enters, stares at the presents.

DUDLEY:
How many are there?

UNCLE VERNON:
Thirty-six. Counted them myself.

DUDLEY:
Thirty-six. But last year...last year I had thirty-seven...

UNCLE VERNON:
Well now, son, some of these are quite a bit bigger than last year--

DUDLEY:
I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE!

AUNT PETUNIA:
Now, now, here's what we'll do. Today, when we're out, we'll buy you two more presents. How's that, popkin?

DUDLEY:
So then I'll have...I'll have...

HARRY:
Thirty-eight, popkin. Aunt Petunia cuffs Harry on the head on her way to the RINGING TELEPHONE.

AUNT PETUNIA:
You just mind that bacon!

HARRY:
Yes, Aunt Petunia. As Dudley tears open a BOX of LEAD SOLDIERS, Uncle Vernon ruffles his hair.

UNCLE VERNON:
Want your money's worth, don't you, tiger. Well, look there. Aunt Marge's sent you the Fourth Battalion? Dudley twists the head off one.

DUDLEY:
This one's lost its head.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Bad news. Mrs. Figgs' broken her leg. She can't take him.

UNCLE VERNON:
We could phone Yvonne.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Don't be silly. She hates the boy.

HARRY:
You could just leave me here.

UNCLE VERNON:
And come back to find the house in ruins?

DUDLEY:
I...Don't...Want...Him...To...Come! He... always... spoils... everything!

AUNT PETUNIA:
Now, precious, don't cry. He won't spoil anything. What if Mummy buys you three more presents.

DUDLEY:
Three?

AUNT PETUNIA:
As many as you want, sweetums. As Aunt Petunia cuddles him, Dudley shoots Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.

UNCLE VERNON:
I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you'll have no meals for a week...

DUDLEY:
Make it move. Uncle Vernon looks over a zoo map at the HUGE BURMESE PYTHON curled beyond the glass. RAPS his knuckles. Nothing.

HARRY:
He's asleep.

DUDLEY:
He's boring. Dudley waddles away and the others follow, all but Harry, who steps forward and rubs Dudley's noseprint from the glass.

HARRY:
Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you... The snake nods. Harry stops, looks off, then back. WHISPERS:

HARRY:
Can you hear me? The snake cocks its head and...winks.

HARRY:
It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean...do you talk to people often? The snake regards Harry...then slowly shakes its head no. Harry nods, looking a bit unnerved.

HARRY:
So...you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family? (listening) I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either...

DUDLEY:
MUMMY! DAD! COME HERE! You won't believe what this snake is doing! Dudley JABS Harry hard in the ribs, sending him tumbling to the concrete, floor. Angry, Harry looks up as Dudley leans against the^glass and it...VANISHES. Dudley flops forward, the snake slithers out, and people run screaming. Stunned, Harry watches the python slip into the sunshine, then glances back to the snake tank. The glass has reappeared and Dudley sits within, face pale, eyes frozen in terror.

HARRY:
I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone. It was like magic. Uncle Vernon hurls Harry into the cupboard, stares hard.

UNCLE VERNON:
There's...no...such...thing...as... magic! The door SLAMS. Harry sits quietly. Then, from his pocket, he removes the damaged soldier Dudley had discarded earlier. Reaching up, he places it on a dark shelf, next to half a dozen others.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Oh, Vernon, look at him. To think in only a week he'll be off to Smeltings.

HARRY:
(with dread) Will I have to wear that too?

AUNT PETUNIA:
You! Go to Smeltings? Don't be stupid. You'll goto state school, where you belong. That there'll be yours, once I'm done dying it. Harry glances at a tub of grey mud boiling on the stove.

HARRY:
But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Fit you fine enough. Now fetch the post.

UNCLE VERNON:
Marge's ill. Ate a funny whelk... BAM! Dudley brings the Smelting stick down-hard on the table.

DUDLEY:
Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! Quickly, Uncle Vernon SNATCHES it away.

HARRY:
That's mine!

UNCLE VERNON:
Yours. Who'd be writing to you— Uncle Vernon's face goes pale.

HARRY:
I want my letter!

DUDLEY:
I want my stick! Harry and Dudley make a furious play for the keyhole, but Dudley's size proves too much and Harry, glasses dangling from one ear, settles for the crack between door and floor. HARRY'S POV of Uncle Vernon's thick black shoes pacing back and forth.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Vernon. Look at the address. How could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?

UNCLE VERNON:
Watching. Spying. Following us. We both know the dangerous nonsense your sister and her husband were mixed up in.

AUNT PETUNIA:
But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back. Tell them we don't want—

UNCLE VERNON:
No. We'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer...Yes, that's best...I'll burn it.

HARRY:
NO! I WANT MY LETTER!

UNCLE VERNON:
Fine day, Sunday. Best day of the week in my opinion. Know why I say that, Dudley?

HARRY:
(entering) Because there's no post on Sundays. Uncle Vernon looks up brightly, but Harry's eyes are on the window behind him. Outside, the sky is DARK WITH OWLS.

UNCLE VERNON:
Right you are, Harry! No damn letters today! No sir. Not one blasted... Just then, something WHIZZES DOWN the chimney and SMACKS Uncle Vernon flat on the back of the head. Seconds later another follows, and then another, until the living room is aflock with...LETTERS. Harry leaps onto a table, trying to snag one, when Uncle Vernon seizes him by the waist.

DUDLEY:
Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly!

UNCLE VERNON:
That does it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us! Where they can't get to us! Dudley glances at his mother.

DUDLEY:
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

HARRY:
Make a wish, Harry. Closing his eyes, he...blows...and the "flames" of dust scatter. Eyes still closed, Harry holds the wish when... BOOM! The DOOR SHUDDERS. HINGES squeal. A pin squirrels out of its housing. Falls to the floor. BOOM! Uncle Vernon comes sledding into the room in his socks, a RIFLE in hand, paper hanging by a string from the barrel.

UNCLE VERNON:
Who's there? I warn you--I'm armed! SMASH! The door falls flat. An IMMENSE SILHOUETTE stands against the raging sea outside, identical to the beastly figure seen climbing the stairs in Godric's Hollow. He is HAGRID and is, rather obviously, a GIANT. Presently he is standing on the front door.

HAGRID:
Er, right. Sorry 'bout that... Hagrid steps clear, takes the door, and fits it back into its frame. Glances at Dudley. Frowns.

HAGRID:
Mind, I haven't seen yeh since you was a baby, Harry, but yeh're a bit more along than I woulda expected. ’Specially round the middle.

DUDLEY:
(terrified) I'm not Harry.

HARRY:
I am. Hagrid turns, watches Harty's face come into the light.

HAGRID:
Well now, course yeh are.

UNCLE VERNON:
I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!

HAGRID:
Ah, dry up, Dursley, yeh great prune. Hagrid takes the rifle, knots it like a piece of licorice.

HAGRID:
Anyway, Harry. Got summat fer yeh. ’Fraid I mighta sat on it at some point, but ’magine it'll taste all right jus' the same...let's see now...got it here somewhere... Hagrid rummages in his coat, removes: a kettle, frying pan, sausages, one PINK UMBRELLA and, finally, a squashed paper box containing a CHOCOLATE CAKE with "Happee Birthdae, Harry" scrawled in green icing.

HAGRID:
Baked it meself, words an' all.

HARRY:
Thank you.

HARRY:
Excuse me, but.. .who are you? Harry stares blankly. Hagrid frowns.

HAGRID:
Blimey, Harry, did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all?

HARRY:
Learned what?

HAGRID:
What? DURSLEY!!! Do yeh mean ter tell me the boy knows nothin? Uncle Vernon stands mute. Hagrid simmers, then shakes his head and turns back to the fire.

HAGRID:
’Harry, yer a wizard. For a moment, the hut is utterly silent.

HARRY:
I'm a what?

HAGRID:
A Wizard. And a thumpin' good 'un, I'd wager, once yeh've been trained up a bit.

HARRY:
No. You've made a mistake. I...I can't be a...wizard. I mean...I'm just...Harry. Just Harry.

HAGRID:
Tha' right. Tell me, Harry. Ever make somethin' strange 'appen? When yeh was scared maybe. Or angry? As Harry looks up in recognition, Hagrid slaps a soggy ENVELOPE into Harry's hand. Harry opens it, reads.

UNCLE VERNON:
He'll not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish!

HARRY:
You knew? You knew I'm a...a wizard? Aunt Petunia—looking furious—emerges from the shadows.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, mother and father were so proud when the letter came. A witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful. I was the only one who saw her for what she was...a freak! (distastefully) Then she met that Potter and had you. I knew you'd be the same. Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you—

HARRY:
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash.

HAGRID:
CAR CRASH! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal!

UNCLE VERNON:
HE'LL NOT BE GOING, I TELL YOU!

HAGRID:
An' I s'ppose a great Muggle like yerself is goin' ter stop him.

HARRY:
Muggle?

UNCLE VERNON:
I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks! Hagrid spins, eyes bulging. HAGRID NEVER..INSULT...ALBUS...DUMBLEDORE. ..IN...FRONT...OF..ME! Hagrid spins, points the umbrella at Uncle Vernon, then spies Dudley, one hand deep in Harry's birthday cake. POP!—a FLASH of VIOLET LIGHT hits Dudley square in the rump. Instantly, a PIG’S TAIL curls through the back of his trousers. Uncle Vernon ROARS, hurries everyone out of the room.

HAGRID:
Tha’s curious. Meant ter turn ’im into a complete pig, whole hog an all. Suppose he was so much like a pig already, there wasn't much left ter do. Hagrid sees Harry staring in awe at the pink umbrella.

HAGRID:
Er, be grateful if yeh didn't mention that to anyone at Hogwarts. Strictly speakin', I'm not allowed ter do magic. (checks pocket watch) Bit behind schedule, aren't we? Best be off. Hagrid exits, leaving Harry to consider his sorry surroundings. He looks momentarily at a loss, then...Hagrid pokes his head back in.

HAGRID:
T'Less, o' course, yeh'd rather stay.

HARRY:
'First year students will require three sets of plain work robes, one plain pointed hat for day wear, one pair of dragon-hide gloves...' Hagrid chuckles at a PARKING METER.

HAGRID:
Things these Muggles dream up...

HARRY:
'...and the following Set Books: The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk. One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore...'

HARRY:
'One wand, one standard Size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad.' (looking up) Can we find all this in London? Hagrid pauses by a NARROW GRAY DOOR that stands between a BOOK SHOP on one side and a RECORD SHOP on the other.

HAGRID:
If yen know where to go.

QUIRRELL:
Harry P-P-Potter. C-Can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.

HAGRID:
Professor! Didn't see yeh there. Harry, this 'ere's Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

QUIRRELL:
F-F-Fearfully f-fascinating subject. N-Not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter? Quirrell's eyes flutter nervously over Harry's scar.

HAGRID:
Yes, well, must get on. Lots ter buy. (as he pulls Harry along) See? Tol' yeh you was famous.

HARRY:
Why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there. How is it they know who I am?

HAGRID:
Don' know that I'm the right one ter tell yeh that, Harry. Let's see now...Three up...Two across...Right. Stand back now.

HAGRID:
Welcome, Harry. To Diagon Alley.

PLUMP WOMAN:
Seventeen Sickles an ounce for Dragon Liver, can you imagine? They're mad!

MOTHER:
It says brass, Trevor. As such, you will get brass,

BOY:
There it is! The Nimbus Two Thousand! Runs a good twenty times faster than the old Comets. Neil Marks himself rides it for the Chudley Cannons.

FATHER:
Mind you don't drop your bottle of eel's eye, Belinda, I'll not buy you another. Harry tries to take in everything at once, marveling at shops specializing in everything from cauldrons, owls and broomsticks to robes, 'unmentionables,' and spell books.

HARRY:
Dragon Liver? Do they mean from a real dragon?

HAGRID:
Well, they don't mean a ruddy penguin. Crikey, I'd like a dragon.

HARRY:
You'd like a dragon?

HAGRID:
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood...

HARRY:
(staring in a cauldron shop) But how am I to pay for all this, Hagrid? I haven't any money. Hagrid gestures to a TOWERING, SNOW-WHITE BUILDING ahead.

HAGRID:
There's yer money. Gringotts. Wizard's Bank. No place safer, Harry. Not one. 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.

HARRY:
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly was that?

HAGRID:
Yer basic Door Goblin. Clever as they come goblins, but not yer most friendly beasts. Best stay close. (stepping up to a teller) Mornin'. Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.

GOBLIN:
And Mr. Harry Potter has his key?

HAGRID:
Let's see, got it 'ere somewhere... The Goblin looks on disfavorably as Hagrid rifles his coat, producing in rapid succession: a jangly RING of KEYS, one BALL of STRING, a fistful of MINT HUMBUGS, two TEABAGS, and a MOTH...which simply flutters from one pocket to another.

HAGRID:
Ah, 'ere's the li'l devil. (leaning close) There's another matter as well. I've got a letter from Professor Dumbledore. It's about the You- Know-What in Vault You-Know-Which.

HAGRID:
Din' think yer parents would leave yeh with nothin', did yeh?

GRIPHOOK:
Vault Seven Hundred Thirteen.

HARRY:
What's in here, Hagrid?

HAGRID:
Can’t tell yeh that, Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret. Griphook steps up to a door with no keyhole, strokes it with one long finger, and it simply MELTS away.

HAGRID:
Anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door.

HARRY:
How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?

GRIPHOOK:
About once every ten years.

HAGRID:
Best not mention this ter anyone either, Harry.

HARRY:
I still need...a wand.

HAGRID:
(points ahead) Only place for wands, is Ollivanders. You go inside. I got one more thing I gotta'do. Harry nods, walks into Ollivanders.

OLLIVANDER:
I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. Seems only yesterday your mother and father we're in here buying their first wands... Ollivander steps down.with a pair of slender boxes.

OLLIVANDER:
(extending a box) Here we are. Just give it a wave. Feeling a bit supid, Harry raises his arm. Nothing.

OLLIVANDER:
No. Apparently not. Perhaps this. Harry raises it and...BRIGHT LIGHT shoots forth...sending a CRYSTAL VASE OF BLACK ROSES shattering to the floor.

OLLIVANDER:
I wonder... Ollivander descends, presents a box. Stifling a yawn, Harry takes the wand...and his expression changes.

OLLIVANDER:
Go on then. As Harry extends his arm his hand trembles. A breeze stirs, sending the shop's tiny bell RINGING. The pages of a BOOK FLUTTER on the counter, and Harry's hair feathers off his forehead, showing his scar. Astounded, Harry smiles and then.. .Ollivander slips the wand from his fingers and the breeze dies, the shop returning to its eerie calm. OLLIVANDER. Curious. Very curious...

HARRY:
Sorry, but what's curious?

OLLIVANDER:
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It's curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother... (eyes shifting) ...gave you that scar.

HARRY:
And who owned that wand? Ollivander exchanges a surprised glance with Hagrid.

HAGRID:
We don't speak his name, Harry.

OLLIVANDER:
Terrible, yes. But great. Harry looks out the window, sees Hagrid standing there, bolding a cage with a snow white Owl inside. Harry turns to say goodbye to Ollivander. He's gone. Harry runs outside.

HAGRID:
Happy Birthday, Harry.

HARRY:
(excited) For me?...Really?...He's Mine?...

HAGRID:
Crikey, yeh'd think yeh hadn't gotten a birthday present before.

HARRY:
I haven't. Not really.

HAGRID:
You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet.

HARRY:
(touching his scar) He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do. Hagrid studies Harry, conflicted, then sets down his spoon. HAGRID.

HAGRID:
Firs', un'erstand this, 'cause it's important: not all yer wizards are good. Some go bad. Years ago, there was this one wizard who went as bad as you could go. His name was...was...

HARRY:
Maybe if you wrote it down.

HAGRID:
Nah—can' spell it. All right— Voldemort.

HARRY:
Voldemort? Hagrid shivers, holds up his hand, and glances quickly about the shadows of the pub before continuing.

HAGRID:
Dark days those were, Harry. Volde...You-Know-Who...started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em too. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Including yer parents. No one lived once he decided to kill 'em. Not one. 'Cept you.

HARRY:
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

HAGRID:
That's no ord'nary cut on your forehead. A mark like that only comes when yeh've been touched by a curse. An evil curse. Just then, a HIGH, CACKLING VOICE pierces the silence. Harry turns, sees an OLD WOMAN laughing with the gummy bartender.

HAGRID:
Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. I reckon he's out there somewhere, jus' too weak to carry on. But one thing's fer certain, Harry. Somethin' about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why e'ryone knows yer name. Hagrid leans close once more and t-Ms time his voice is barely a WHISPER.

HAGRID:
You're the boy who lived.

HAGRID:
Blimey, look at the time. 'Fraid I 'ave ter be leavin' yeh now, Harry. Dumbledore will be wantin'— Hagrid pats his LEFT POCKET. Catches himself.

HAGRID:
He'll be wantin' ter see me. (handing him a TICKET) That there's yer train. Leaves in about ten minutes time. Jus' make sure yeh stick ter yeh ticket. That's very important, Harry. Stick ter yeh ticket...

HARRY:
There must be something wrong, Hagrid. This says Platform Nine and Three Quarters. There's no such thing... Harry looks up, but Hagrid...is gone.

HARRY:
...Is there?

HARRY:
Excuse me. Can you tell me where I might find Platform Nine and Three- Quarters.

STATION OFFICER:
(grumbling off) Think you're funny, do you? Nine and Three-Quarters indeed... Harry looks about, despairingly, then HEARS... MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.) ...packed with Muggles, of course. Harry turns, sees a plump woman (MRS. WEASLEY) hurrying along FOUR RED-HEADED BOYS and their little, red-headed sister (GINNY). The boys all tow trunks identical to Harry's. MRS. WEASLEY All right, Percy. You first. Harry watches the tallest boy walk straight toward a dividing barrier.and...VANISH. Harry squints in confusion. Next, Mrs. Weasley turns to a pair of cheeky twins (FRED and GEORGE). MRS. WEASLEY Fred. You next.

FRED:
I'm not Fred. I'm George. Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? MRS. WEASLEY Sorry, George.

FRED:
Only joking. I am Fred. Fred dashes off, trailed by George. They too vanish.

HARRY:
Excuse me. Could you tell me— MRS. WEASLEY

NEW ANGLE ON PLATFORM:
Harry struggles with his heavy trunk as all around him people say goodbye to their families. A round-faced boy (NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM) turns frantically to his GRAN.

NEVILLE:
Gran! I've lost my toad again.

GRAN:
Oh, Neville. Honestly. Not again... Further up, a BOY IN DREADLOCKS (LEE JORDAN) holds a BOX.

STUDENT:
Go on, Lee. Give us a look. As Lee lifts the LID, a LONG HAIRY LEG protrudes and students SHRIEK. Unimpressed, one of the twins spots Harry struggling.

GEORGE:
Want a hand?

HARRY:
Yes, please.

GEORGE:
Oy! C'mere, Fred! Take a handle.

HARRY:
Thanks very much.

GEORGE:
Blimey. You're...

FRED:
Harry Potter.

HARRY:
What? Oh, him. Yes. I mean, I am. MRS. WEASLEY Fred! George! Come say goodbye to Ginny. Mrs. Weasley stands waving, the redheaded girl clinging to her dress. The twins take one last look at Harry, dash off.

PERCY:
Have to go, Mother. The other Prefects are expecting me up front.

FRED:
Mum! Guess who’s on the train? Right now. FRED/GEORGE Harry Potter!

GINNY:
Oh, Mum, can I go on and see him? Please. MRS. WEASLEY Certainly not. The boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.

FRED:
Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.

GEORGE:
Great idea, though, thanks, Mum!

RON:
Mind? Everywhere else is full.

HARRY:
Not at all.

RON:
I’m Ron, by the way.

HARRY:
I heard. I’m Harry.

RON:
I...heard.

RON:
Wicked.

HARRY:
Are all your family wizards?

RON:
Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we never talk about him. I heard you went to live with Muggles. What are they like?

HARRY:
Horrible. Well, not all of them. Mine are, though. Trade them for three wizard brothers any day.

RON:
Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even Scabbers used to be Percy's... Ron reaches into his pocket, pulls out a fat, gray, seemingly unconscious, RAT (SCABBERS).

RON:
Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically. Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead. Roh looks embarrassed. Just then, a DIMPLED WOMAN pushing a TROLLEY FULL OF SWEETS pops her head in.

DIMPLED WOMAN:
Anything off the trolley, dears? Ron mumbles 'No thanks,' takes out a lumpy sandwich. Harry studies him, then digs into his pockets, heavy with coin.

HARRY:
We'll take the lot. CLOSE UP: TROVE OF TREATS

HARRY:
'Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans'?

RON:
They mean every flavor. There's chocolate, peppermint...but you can also get liver or spinach or tripe. George reckons he had a bogey- flavored one once.

HARRY:
These aren't real frogs, are they? Harry holds up a pack of "CHOCOLATE FROGS"—something is wriggling under the foil—then sees that Ron already has a very realistic leg squirreling out the corner of his mouth.

RON:
(mumbling) Just a spell. Besides, it's the card you want. Each pack's got a Famous Witch or Wizard. Got about 500 myself. Watch it! As Harry breaks the foil on his pack, the frog springs into the air and out the open train window.

RON:
That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with. Harry glances at the card in his hand. On it, there's a MAN with a crooked nose, long silver beard, and half-moon glasses. Underneath is a name: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.

HARRY:
I've gotten Dumbledore!

RON:
I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy.

HARRY:
(reading the back) 'Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for his discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Approximately one hundred and fifty years old, Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music, tenpin bowling, and... (looking up) One hundred and fifty years old?

RON:
Thought he'd be older, did you?

HARRY:
No--I--Hey, he's gone. Harry holds up the cardn-now blank--to Ron, who only shrugs.

RON:
Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?

HARRY:
It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos.

RON:
Really? They don't move at all? Weird! Just then, Scabbers SNORTS, falls back asleep.

RON:
Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a spell that's to turn him yellow. Want to see? Harry nods, eager to see some magic. Ron pulls out a BATTERED WAND--just as the compartment door OPENS and a GIRL with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth looks in. She is HERMIONE GRANGER and is already wearing her school robes.

HERMIONE:
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one. (seeing Ron's wand)

RON:
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. Scabbers SNORTS, but otherwise remains fat, grey, and asleep.

HERMIONE:
Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example... To Harry's surprise, Hermione takes her wand, points it directly over his brow, then...stops.

HERMIONE:
Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century.

HARRY:
Am I?

HERMIONE:
Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me. (raising her wand) Anyway...Oculus Reparo. instantly, the cracked bridge of Harry's glasses is mended.

HERMIONE:
There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way. And you are...? Ron is still staring at the glasses, feeling a bit outdone.

RON:
Um...Ron Weasley.

HAGRID:
Firs' years! Firs' years over here! Hagrid gives Harry a wink as he comes loping out of the darkness, swinging a LAMP. Ron, preoccupied with wiping his nose clean on his robes, stops, dumbstruck by Hagrid's size.

HAGRID:
You there! Don' be trailin' yer fingers in the water. Yeh might find yeh don' get 'em all back. Harry turns, sees that Hagrid is speaking to a POINTY-FACED BOY (DRACO MALFOY). Malfoy eyes Hagrid darkly, whispers to a PAIR OF THICK-LOOKING BOYS (CRABBE and GOYLE). Harry peers into the black water, sees his own pale face looking back, then a soft GLITTER of REFLECTED LIGHT dances on the surface. He looks up, watches a magnificent CASTLE drift into view. Hogwarts.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Welcome to Hogwarts. In a moment, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates, but before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your Houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While here, your House is, in many ways, your family. Your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose points. At the end of the year, the House with the most is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you... Just then, a rather LARGE TOAD springs forth, CROAKS.

NEVILLE:
Trevor! Neville, blissfully relieved, gathers his toad, then peers up from the hem of Professor McGonagall's robes.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
...will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily. Professor McGonagall glowers at Neville, then exits. As she goes, there is a BRIEF CLAMOR of SOUND from the students waiting in the Great Hall beyond.

HARRY:
How exactly do they sort us?

RON:
Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was joking. At least...I think he was. Just then, Draco Malfoy pushes through the crowd, shadowed by the boys from the boat. Malfoy stares openly at Harry's scar.

MALFOY:
Oh. This is Crabbe and Goyle. And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. Ron COUGHS, masking a snigger. Malfoy's eyes narrow.

MALFOY:
Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, freckles, and a hand-me-ddwn robe-- you must be a Weasley. (to Harry) You'll soon find out some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. Malfoy extends his hand, but Harry's gaze remains level.

HARRY:
I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. Malfoy's eyes glitter with rage. Finally he drops his hand, turns away.

HERMIONE:
Well, he's rather disagreeable, isn't he? Ron and Harry turn, see Hermione. Just then, Professor McGonagall returns.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
We are ready for you.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words. Harry watches with great interest as the great wizard himself rises from his seat at the High Table.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes, and here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you! The Great Hall THUNDERS with APPLAUSE.

HERMIONE:
I hear he's a genius. As the applause subsides, the hat TWITCHES. At the brim, a rip OPENS WIDE, and the hat begins to TALK.

SORTING HAT:
Oh, you may not think I'm pretty But don't judge on what you see I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.... As the students APPLAUD, the hat takes a bow and Professor McGonagall: steps forward with a ROLL OF PARCHMENT.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
When I call your name, you will come forth, put on the hat and be sorted. (consulting her list) Hermione Granger.

HERMIONE:
Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says nothing and we're all just left standing here forever...

RON:
(as she goes mumbling off) Mental, that one. I'm telling you. Both watch Hermione seat herself, lower the Hat. SORTING HAT GRYFFINDOR! Percy pulls out a chair for Hermione at the Gryffindor table.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Draco Malfoy.

RON:
Slytherin. Draco Malfoy swaggers forth and grips the hat. He's barely touched it to his head, when:

SORTING HAT:
SLYTHERIN!

RON:
(off Harry's amazement) There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. Draco's father was one of the first to join You-Know-Who when he got power. And one of the first to come back when he lost it.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Susan Bones. As SUSAN BONES dashes up front, Harry glances to the High Table. Dumbledore watches the proceedings placidly, while Professor Quirrell talks to a hook-nosed man with greasy black hair and sallow skin, PROFESSOR SNAPE. Slowly, as if he can feel Harry's gaze, Snape turns, looks straight into Harry's eyes. Instantly, a Sharp, hot PAIN shoots across Harry's scar.

HARRY:
Ouch!

RON:
Harry? What is it?

HARRY:
N-nothing. I'm fine.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Ronald Weasley. As Ron steps nervously away, Harry glances back to the High Table. Shape has returned to his conversation.

SORTING HAT:
Gryffindor! Fred and George WHOOP LOUDLY as Ron comes grinning out of the hat, greatly relieved. Harry starts to clap himself when...

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Harry Potter. There is an abrupt drop in the CHATTER. As Harry makes his way, he avoids the eyes of the many who stare and whisper.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
If you will, Mr. Potter. Harry sits, takes the hat, and...slowly...lowers it. He waits, then the hat begins to SPEAK.

SORTING HAT:
Hmmm. Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you...? Harry grips the edge of the stool, closes his eyes. His lips move ever so slightly: Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

SORTING HAT:
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that... No? Well, if you're sure better be GRYFFINDOR! A ROAR erupts from the Gryffindor table. Harry stands shakily and walks to his table, where Percy, the Weasley twins, and Hermione all welcome him. At the High Table, Dumbledore lifts his goblet and, meeting Harry's eyes...nods.

SEAMUS:
I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out. As Percy leans over to pour a strange liquid into Harry's goblet, Harry nods to the High Table, to Professor Snape.

HARRY:
Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

PERCY:
Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House.

HARRY:
What's he teach?

PERCY:
Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after Quirrell's job for years. Just then, several STUDENTS SHRIEK as a volley of GHOSTS stream into the hall overhead. One swoops down.

PERCY:
Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer?

NEARLY HEADLESS NICK:
Dismal. What with the Slytherins winning the House Cup six years in a row, the Bloody Baron's become unbearable. Nick nods his head in the direction of the Slytherin table, where a horrific, BLOOD-STAINED GHOST hovers imperiously.

NEARLY HEADLESS NICK:
Then again, he's always been unbearable.

NEARLY HEADLESS NICK:
I prefer Sir Nicolas, if you don't mind.

HERMIONE:
Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?

NEARLY HEADLESS NICK:
Like this. Seizing himself by the left ear, Nick swings his ENTIRE HEAD off his neck and onto his shoulder, as if it were on a hinge.

NEVILLE:
(blanching) I think I'm done eating. Just then, Dumbledore rises at the High Table.

DUMBLEDORE:
If I may, I have a few start-of- term notices to announce. First Years should note that the. Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all pupils. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you that... FILCH, a sour-looking man, stands near a side exit while MRS. NORRIS, a cat with glittering RED EYES, sits by his feet.

DUMBLEDORE:
...no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, please note that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Hearing this, Ron stops chewing for the first time, glances at Harry. But before either can speak...

DUMBLEDORE:
And now, let us sing the school song! Everyone pick their favorite tune and off we go!

SCHOOL SINGING:
Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us things worth knowing Bring back what we've forgot. Just do your best, we'll do the rest And learn until our brains all rot...

PERCY:
This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course, when the staircases...change. As the staircase before them moves to the right, Percy waits briefly, then leads on without comment to a...

PERCY:
Gryffindors, I give you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist. POP! A tiny translucent man with wicked eyes and wide mouth appears, clutching the last walking stick. He is PEEVES.

PEEVES:
Oooh! Ickle Firsties! What fun! With that, Peeves swoops off, wagging his tongue and bouncing a walking stick off Neville's head.

PERCY:
(walking on) Rather a nuisance, I'm afraid. Ah. Here we are.

PINK LADY:
Password?

PERCY:
Caput Draconis. The portrait SWINGS FORWARD, revealing a ROUND HOLE in the wall. The students all scramble through it, into the...

PERCY:
Girls' dormitory to the left. Boys to the right. You'll find your belongings have already been brought up. Any questions? (no one speaks) Then, goodnight all. Oh, and don't forget. Before retiring, please place all living potion ingredients in your cupboards. This includes slugs, fire beetles and cutworms. Sweet dreams...

RON:
This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase Seven—no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven...

HARRY:
How many staircases are there?

HERMIONE:
One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot makes unattributed reference to three others. Harry arid Ron watch Hermione pass by, apparently holding every single First Year course book in her arms.

RON:
I hate her.

RON:
Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late first day out... Hearing this, the cat narrows its eyes, leaps up and...TRANSFORMS...into old McGonagall herself. Ron's mouth drops open in amazement.

RON:
That was bloody brilliant!

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. But perhaps it might be more useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter or yourself into a pocket watch. That way one of you might be on time.

HARRY:
We got lost.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Then perhaps a map. I trust you don't need one to find your seats? Harry and Ron Slink past Hermione, sitting front row center.

SNAPE:
There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few... (glances at Malfoy) ...who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you howto bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to...not pay attention. Harry blinks, realizes Snape is looking at him.

SNAPE:
Mr. Potter. Our hew...celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? Harry looks at a loss. Hermione’s hand shoots into the air.

SNAPE:
You don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?

HARRY:
I don't know, sir.

SNAPE:
And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? Harry sees Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle sniggering.

HARRY:
I don't know, sir.

SNAPE:
Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter.

HARRY:
Clearly Hermione knows. It seems a pity not to ask her.. Neville, Seamus and a few other Gryffindors LAUGH.

SNAPE:
Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl! Hermione wilts. Snape steps toward Harry, eyes glimmering.

SNAPE:
For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. (to the others) Well, why aren't you all copying this down? The students scramble for their quills and parchment.

SNAPE:
And Gryffindors. Note that five points will be taken from your House for your classmate's cheek.

SEAMUS:
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...

HARRY:
What’s Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

RON:
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it... PFFFT! BLUE FLAMES shoot over the rim of the glass.

RON:
Two Knuts says he loses his eyebrows by week's end. Ah, mail's here. DOZENS OF OWLS circle the ceiling, then swoop down, dropping parcels from home. A copy of The Daily Prophet rolls onto the table near Harry.

RON:
Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall! Neville holds a GLASS BALL filled with WHITE SMOKE. Slowly, the smoke begins to turn a DEEP SCARLET.

HERMIONE:
I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.

NEVILLE:
Only problem is...I can't remember what I've forgotten. Harry, Daily Prophet in hand, nudges Ron.

HARRY:
Hey, Ron. Somebody broke into Gringotts! Listen: 'Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.' That’s odd.

RON:
It’s mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults.

HARRY:
No. It’s just odd...That’s the day Hagrid and I were there.

MADAME HOOCH:
Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. Well, what are you all waiting for? Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come now. Hurry up. Harry steps forward nervously, glances down. His broom is old, with twigs sticking out at odd angles.

MADAME HOOCH:
Stick out your right hand, Over the broom, and say "Up"! SHOUTS of "Up!" ring on the cold afternoon air. Though he barely WHISPERS the command, Harry’s broom SNAPS smartly into his hand. Hermione's simply rolls over. Ron's FLIES UP and CRACKS HIM IN THE NOSE.

MADAME HOOCH:
Now. Once you’ve got hold of the broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight. We don't want you sliding off the end. (walking the row) Your other right hand, Mr. Finnegan. Goodness, boy, what have you done with your eyebrows?

SEAMUS:
Lost 'em, ma'am.

MALFOY:
Excuse me, Madam Hooch. Given that a few of us have been on sticks for years, would it not make sense to separate the expert flyers from... (glancing at Harry)

MADAME HOOCH:
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, but I’m sure even an expert flyer such as yourself can appreciate the benefits of reacquainting oneself with the basics. Your grip, for example. It's thumb in, not out. As Malfoy reddens, Harry and Ron share a grin.

MADAME HOOCH:
Very well. Now when I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground. Hard. Keep your brooms steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...Three...Two... Jumping the gun entirely, a nervous Neville shoots straight up into the air, like a cork out of a bottle.

MADAME HOOCH:
Mr. Longbottom! Exactly where do you think you're going? Clutching desperately to his broom, Neville caroms crazily off a tree, flops upside down, rockets past the other students—who duck—then soars into a mad spiraling climb.

MADAME HOOCH:
Come down here this instant! Neville's pale face peers down, his eyes roll up...

MADAME HOOCH:
On your broomstick, Longbottom! Too late. With a giant THUD and a nasty CRACK, Neville hits the pitch. Madame Hooch and the Gryffindors rush over.

MADAME HOOCH:
Broken wrist. Come on, dear. Up you get. (leading him off) Everyone's to keep their feet on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the Hospital Wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say 'Quidditch.'

MALFOY:
Did you see his face? Perhaps if the great lump had given this a squeeze, he would've remembered to fall on his fat arse.

HARRY:
Give it here, Malfoy.

MALFOY:
No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a tree? Malfoy slings a leg over his broom, KICKS into the air.

MALFOY:
What's the matter, Potter? A bit beyond your reach? Harry glowers up at Malfoy, then GRABS his broom.

HERMIONE:
Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to...fly. Harry shoots into the sky, so angry that it's a moment before he realizes what the others see clearly: he's a natural. Turning his broomstick sharply, he hovers, glaring at Malfoy.

HARRY:
Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom.

MALFOY:
Is that so? Harry SHOOTS forth like a javelin, Malfoy just managing to slip his charge. As Harry whips around, Malfoy glances down at the ground, clearly unnerved. Harry simply smiles.

MALFOY:
Have it your way, then!

MALFOY:
Chin up, Potter. They might let you stay on as Hagrid's assistant.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Excuse me, Professor Quirrell, could I borrow Wood for a moment. Startled, Professor Quirrell jumps, then OLIVER WOOD, a burly fifth-year, emerges, glances curiously at Harry.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood...I've found you a Seeker.

RON:
Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--

HARRY:
--a century. According to McGonagall. Just then, Fred and George descend.

RON:
Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters.

GEORGE:
Our job to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.

FRED:
Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...

GEORGE:
But they turn up in a month or two. As the twins dash off, Ron reads Harry's troubled fade.

RON:
Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too.

HARRY:
But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?

HERMIONE:
You won't make a fool of yourself. Ron and Harry turn. They hadn't’even noticed Hermione.

HERMIONE:
It's in your blood.

RON:
Harry...you didn't tell me your father was a Seeker too.

RON:
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.

HARRY:
Who doesn't? Just then, the staircase LURCHES beneath their feet...

RON:
Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?

HERMIONE:
We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden.

HARRY:
(intrigued) Why, though?

HERMIONE:
Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go. Meow. They freeze. A CAT sits watching them, eyes glittering in the dark. Then...a SHADOW scales the wall.

FILCH:
Who goes there! They turn, dash the opposite way. As they reach a DOOR, Harry grips the knob, twists. It's LOCKED.

FILCH:
Lead me to them, my sweet....

RON:
That's it. We're done for.

HERMIONE:
Standard Book of Spells. Chapter Seven.

RON:
Chapter Seven?

HERMIONE:
Shhh! Filch is...gone.

RON:
He probably thinks this door is locked.

HERMIONE:
It was locked.

HARRY:
And for good reason... Hermione and Ron turn. Standing a feet away is a DOG...only this one has three heads, three pairs of mad, rolling eyes, and three sets of hideous yellow fangs dripping with saliva. As the dog ROARS, they tumble back outside and...

RON:
What do they think they're doing keeping a thing like that locked up in school?

RON:
I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three.

HERMIONE:
It was standing on a trapdoor, which means-it's not there by accident. It's...

HARRY:
Guarding something.

HERMIONE:
That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse...expelled.

WOOD:
Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players: Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and the Seeker— that's you. There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle. (holds up a red ball) The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of three hoops. The Keeper—that's me—defends the hoops. With me so far? Harry nods, points to a WOOD CRATE rocking Violently.

HARRY:
I think so. What's in there?

WOOD:
Here. Take this.

WOOD:
Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. Careful now, it's coming back. As the ball screams back to earth, Wood crates it.

HARRY:
What was that?

WOOD:
Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you're a Seeker. The only ball I want you to worry about is...this. Wood takes out a TINY BALL about the size of a walnut. BRIGHT GOLD, it has little, fluttering WINGS.

HARRY:
I like this ball.

WOOD:
You like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

HARRY:
What do I do with it?

WOOD:
Catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter...we win.

PROFESSOR FLITWICK:
Now don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been, practising. Swish and flick. Swish and flick. Harry, paired with Seamus, poses his wand over the FEATHER before him and begins to swish and flick.

HARRY:
Wingardium Leviosa. The feather flutters, but never leaves the table.

PROFESSOR FLITWICK:
And enunciate! Never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest. RON WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA! Ron windmills his arms grandly. Nothing. Hermione frowns.

HERMIONE:
Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh- sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah.

RON:
You do it then, if you're so clever.

HERMIONE:
Wingardium Leviosa. Hermione swishes and flicks. Instantly the feather rises.

PROFESSOR FLITWICK:
Oh, well done! Everyone see here. Miss Granger's done it! PFFFT! Across the room, SMOKE curls between Seamus and Harry.

HARRY:
I think we’re going to need another feather over here, Professor.

RON:
It'sLevi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o- saaaah. She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends. JuSt then, someone BUMPS into Harry. He turns, sees Hermione dash by, hugging her books, eyes glittering; with tears.

HARRY:
I think she heard you.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
How are you, Potter? All right?

HARRY:
Yes, Professor. Fine.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
I know...that is, we know...the members of the staff...that this is perhaps a difficult night for you. Halloween. Your parents... Harry realizes what she is talking about. Nods.

HARRY:
I'm all right, Professor.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Very well. She turnsstarts to go.

HARRY:
Professor...Thank you.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
You're welcome, Potter. As she goes, Harry sees Ron glumly pushing his food around, listening to Neville speak across the EMPTY CHAIR to Seamus.

NEVILLE:
Parvati Patil said she wouldn't come out of the girls' bathroom. Said she's been in there all afternoon. Crying. Just then, Professor Quirrell runs into the room, CRIES OUT:

QUIRRELL:
TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE

DUMBLEDORE:
Everyone will please not panic. Prefects, lead your Houses back to the dormitories. Teachers, follow me to the dungeons.

HARRY:
How could a troll get in?

RON:
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes... (seeing Harry's face) What?

HARRY:
Hermione. She doesn't know.

HARRY:
That's the third-floor he's going to. Teachers were supposed to go to the dungeons... (wrinkling his nose) What's that?

RON:
Smells like Fred's socks. Only...worse. Much worse. Lumbering toward them is a TROLL with an ENORMOUS CLUB. As it comes into a PATCH OF MOONLIGHT, it blinks stupidly, peers into a doorway, then slouches slowly inside.

HARRY:
Follow me. Harry edges forward, pulls the SWORD from the suit of armor, and runs it through the door handle, trapping the troll.

RON:
Yes! Harry grins, then HEARS a high, petrified SCREAM.

HARRY:
This wouldn't be the girl's bathroom, would it? CUT TO: CLOSE UP — HERMIONE SCREAMING

RON:
Don't worry, Hermione! We're here! (turning to Harry) She's dead.

HERMIONE:
I heard that!

RON:
What do we do?

HARRY:
(looking about frantically) Confuse it!

RON:
Confuse it? (SHRUGGING) Hey, pea brain! Harry and Ron grab anything they can arid begin to hurl it at the troll, but they might as well be throwing marshmallows. As shards of wood bounce off its pint-sized head and great lumpy shoulders, the troll brings the club down once more and SHATTERS the last stall. As Harry and Ron look on grimly, the troll jabs its club into the hash of wood before it, poking about for Hermione, when, at the last second... ...she scrambles out and dashes under the sink. GRUNTING furiously, the troll turns, begins to advance on her. Harry, thinking fast, rushes forward and leaps upon the troll's rising club, rising himself...right out of FRAME...and then...dropping... ...right onto the troll's slimy neck. The troll blinks dimly and, before it can react, Harry—purely on instinct—shoves his wand straight up the troll's nose. The troll ROARS in pain, dropping the club and stamping about. Ron watches helplessly, then glances at the club on the floor, an idea flickering across his face. Raising his wand, he SPEAKS:

RON:
Wingardium Leviosa. Harry swings around, sees Ron standing, wand poised. It does not inspire confidence. Ron looks at Hermione, takes a breath, and this time, employs the correct pronunciation.

RON:
Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! With that, the club quivers upon the floor...begins to rise. The troll, still raging, grabs Harry's leg and peels him off his body. As he holds Harry up high, suspended by one leg, Harry's world goes upside down, spinning, when...

HERMIONE:
Is it--dead?

HARRY:
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

RON:
No need to kill it, after all.

HARRY:
Yes, well, that was big of you. Ugh. Troll snot. Harry extracts his wand, wipes it on the troll's trousers. A sudden VOLLEY of FOOTSTEPS announces the arrival of Professors McGonagall, Snape, and a still queasy Quirrell. Harry notices a SPOT OF BLOOD on Snape's leg, sees Snape shift his cloak to cover it.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Explain yourselves! Both of you.

HERMIONE:
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Miss Granger!

HERMIONE:
I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come along...I'd be dead. Ron drops his wand, stunned by Hermione's lie.

HARRY:
Good of her to get us out of trouble like that.

RON:
Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll.

HARRY:
Mind you, she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her. Ron glances at Hermione, then away.

RON:
What are friends for?

RON:
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

HERMIONE:
Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today.

HARRY:
I'm not hungry.

SNAPE:
(appearing)

HERMIONE:
That was...disturbing.

RON:
I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling.

HARRY:
That explains the blood...

HERMIONE:
Blood?

HARRY:
Last night, Ron and I saw Snape heading for the third floor. I'm guessing he let the troll in as a diversion, tried to get past the three-headed dog, and got himself bit. That's why he's limping.

HERMIONE:
But why would anyone go near that dog?

HARRY:
Listen. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business. Very secret.

HERMIONE:
So you're saying...

HARRY:
That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

RON:
"But what's safer than Gringotts?

HARRY:
One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts.

HERMIONE:
Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable.

HARRY:
Or really dangerous. Just then, an OWL beats into the room.

HERMIONE:
Bit early for mail, isn't it?

HARRY:
That's Hedwig. All watch as she swoops down with a LONG, THIN PACKAGE. Harry slips Hedwig a piece of his uneaten toast, strips open the parcel and finds, inside, a sleek mahogany BROOMSTICK.

HARRY:
It's a broomstick.

RON:
That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand.

HARRY:
But who...? Harry glances up, sees—far across the room--Professor McGonagall looking his way. Quickly, she turns away.

WOOD:
I know what you're thinking, Harry. I'm playing my first game of Quidditch, the entire school's watching me and, worst of all, it's against Slytherin. Am I right?

HARRY:
Pretty close.

WOOD:
It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

HARRY:
What happened?

WOOD:
I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head about two minutes in and woke up in the hospital a week later. Madame Hooch, clad in REFEREE ROBES, addresses the players.

MADAME HOOCH:
Now, I want a nice clean game. From all of you. She glances tellingly at Slytherin Captain MARCUS FLINT. Harry leans over to ANGELINA JOHNSON, Gryffindor Chaser.

HARRY:
Who's he, Angelina?

ANGELINA:
Marcus Flint. Slytherin Captain. They say he's got troll blood in him. Harry swallows as Flint glares at him murderously.

MADAME HOOCH:
Mount your brooms, please. Hands trembling, Harry waits, then the WHISTLE BLASTS. FOURTEEN BROOMSTICKS rise into the air. As the crowd ROARS, Madam Hooch kicks the crate, releasing two SCREAMING Bludgers, then tosses up the Quaffle. In the stands, LEE JORDAN does COMMENTARY.

LEE JORDAN:
Quaffle's up...and straight off taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor. What an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive too, I might add. Professor McGonagall casts a disapproving glance at Jordan, then turns to watch the action below.

HAGRID:
Budge up there. Clear the way. How's Harry holdin' up? Ron and Hermione squeeze together, giving Hagrid space.

RON:
He hasn't had much to do yet.

HAGRID:
First game. He stays outta trouble, that'll be doin' enough. Above the pitch, Slytherin's ADRIAN PUCEY eludes two Bludgers, two Weasleys and the Chaser, ZOOMING toward the goals...when suddenly a FLASH OF GOLD zips by his left ear.

HARRY:
The Snitch! Far below, Slytherin Seeker TERENCE HIGGS makes his move. Harry DIVES. Faster than Higgs, he closes the gap quickly, eyes locked on the tiny golden ball. He adds some speed, reaches out, and—WHAM!—Marcus Flint HITS HIM full on, sending him reeling. Harry PULLS UP his tip, LEVELS-OFF, and glances about. But the Snitch is GONE. RON/HERMIONE/HAGRID FOUL! FOUL! FOUL! As a Bludger screams past Harry, he tries to kick his broom higher. Instead, it LURCHES, nearly tossing him off. Below, Hagrid peers through his BINOCULARS, frowns.

RON:
Maybe something happened to it when Flint blocked him. In the stands, people gasp as the broom ROLLS OVER and leaves Harry DANGLING from one end. Neville buries his face.

HAGRID:
No. Can't nothin' interfere with a broomstick except, powerful Dark magic. No kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000. Hearing this, Hermione GRABS Hagrid's binoculars.

HERMIONE:
(whispering to Ron) It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom. Ron takes the binoculars, looks. Snape sits MUTTERING in the opposite stands, staring into the sky. Staring at Harry.

RON:
Jinxing the broom? What do we do?

HERMIONE:
Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles about ten feet below.

HARRY:
What’s George doing?

FRED:
Just in case you fall, George will... (not sure of this himself) ...catch you.

HARRY:
I knew I should have gone out for football.

GEORGE:
What's football?

MALFOY:
Take a good look, lads. With any luck we'll be having Potter soup for supper— Just then, Hermione brushes past, sending Malfoy ass over tea kettle into Professor Quirrell in the row below. Reaching Snape, Hermione crouches down and whips out her wand. Across the field Ron peers through the binoculars...

RON:
Come on, Hermione... Just then, BLUE FLAMES spit from Hermione's wand, climbing quickly up Snape's robes. Snape continues to mutter, staring skyward, then realizes he's on fire, and looks away. In the commotion, that ensues, Ron sees Hermione scoop the blue fire into a little jar, slip it into robe, and make her escape. Instantly, Harry's broom stops jerking. He clambers back on, when—SWOOSH!—A FLASH OF GOLD streaks by him: the Snitch. Higgs ZOOMS UP from below and he and Harry give chase. The Snitch SWERVES, then... DIVES. As it PLUMMETS, Harry and Higgs plummet too, giving it all they've got. On the pitch below, Hermione puts her hand to her mouth. In the stands, Neville buries his head again. As the Snitch drops, the ground rushes crazily upward, the speed breathtaking. Harry seems intoxicated by it, slightly crazed, eyes riveted to the fluttering Snitch, seeing it and only it. Higgs, on the other hand, sees only the ground and, at the last minute, can bear it no longer, PULLING UP on his broom and SWERVING to safety. As Harry and earth collide, the Nimbus cartwheels away, Harry rolls off and, coming up on all fours, Claps his hand to his mouth. As if he were sick.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Well, that's unfortunate. Understandable, but unfortunate. As Harry COUGHS, Hagrid takes back his binoculars, which, unfortunately for Ron, are still around Ron's neck.

HAGRID:
Unfortunate nothin'. He's got the Snitch!

FLINT:
He didn't catch it. He swallowed it!

HERMIONE:
(popping in) Nothing in the Quidditch rulebook discriminates against catching the Snitch in your mouth. Or any other place for that matter. In fact, in a game played in Greece in the late seventeenth century—

MADAME HOOCH:
Thank you, Miss Granger. We can dispense with the more unattractive historical details of the game. Nevertheless, your point is well taken. Match to Gryffindor! As Harry's teammates lift him to their shoulders, Hermione spies Snape in the far stands, limping quickly away, his robes still smoking.

HAGRID:
Rubbish! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

HARRY:
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

HAGRID:
How do you know about Fluffy?

RON:
Fluffy?

HERMIONE:
That thing has a name?

HARRY:
Yes?

HAGRID:
Don' be askin' me anymore. That's top secret, that is.

HARRY:
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.

HAGRID:
Codswallop! Snape's a Hogwart's teacher.

HERMIONE:
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking.

HAGRID:
Now listen to me, all three of yeh— yer meddlin' in things that shouldn't be meddled. It's dangerous. What that dog's guardin' is strictly betw'n Professor Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel— Hagrid stops, furious with himself, then turns for his hut, where FANG, an enormous black boarhound, greets him.

HARRY:
Nicolas Flamel. Why does that name sound familiar?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Listen up! As the lake is frozen, all students going home for holiday will take a flying sleigh to the departure platform. Earmuffs are strongly recommended. Harry and Ron pay no attention to the students bustling about them, sitting alone by the window playing WIZARD CHESS. Unlike Muggle chess, these figures are alive. Presently, Harry's BISHOP looks cross.

BISHOP:
Don't send me there! Can't you see his Knight? Send him. We can afford to lose him. The bishop points to a PAWN. Harry sheepishly complies.

RON:
Queen to pawn six. Ron YAWNS as his queen steps forward and--with extreme prejudice—disposes of the pawn. Hermione, huge trunk in tow, arrives just in time to witness the carnage.

HERMIONE:
Oh my god! That's barbaric!

RON:
That's chess. I see you're packed.

HERMIONE:
I see you're not.

RON:
Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.

HERMIONE:
You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for Nicolas Flamel over holiday.

RON:
We have looked. A hundred times.

HERMIONE:
(as she exits) Not in the Restricted Section.

RON:
I think we've had a bad influence on her.

RON:
Happy Christmas, Harry! Harry rubs his eyes, sees Ron wearing a MAROON SWEATER over his pajamas. Ron tosses him a present.

HARRY:
I've got presents.

RON:
What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater. Harry opens Hagrid's, finds a WOODEN FLUTE. As he blows it, Hedwig cocks her head. It sounds like an owl. Harry takes up the next parcel. It's very light. He reads the NOTE attached.

HARRY:
'Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.' Harry tears the paper away, finds something SHINY and translucent slithers to the floor.

HARRY:
It's some kind of...cloak.

RON:
Well, let's see then. Put it on. As Harry takes the cloth, we hang on Ron, watching, then:

RON:
Ahhh! Harry's head is floating in midair. Ron looks on in awe.

HARRY:
There's no name...It just says, 'Use it well.'

HARRY:
Flamel. Nicolas Flamel... Harry runs his finger along the spines, stops. Takes a LARGE BOOK from the shelf. Runs his hand over the course leather, then...opens it. At once it begins to SHRIEK! Harry SLAMS it shut, but it goes on WAILING. Stumbling back, Harry tips the lamp and all GOES dark. FOOTSTEPS ring out. Frantically, Harry sifts the darkness for the cloak, panicking, when his hands...DISAPPEAR. Pitching the cloak over himself, he dashes to the door, just as it CLANGS open—revealing Filch. As Filch's pale, wide eyes stare straight ahead, Harry glides right past him...

SNAPE:
Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s, yet?

QUIRRELL:
B-b-but Severus, I—

SNAPE:
You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrel.

QUIRRELL:
I don’t know what you—

SNAPE:
You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus... Harry walks slowly, carefully around them, trying not to be heard. Snape stops, as if he's felt a small breeze, then... turns... seeing soft FEATHERS OF VAPOUR. Snape reaches out to touch them... Inside the cloak, Harry puts his hand to his mouth, to stop his breath... Snape finds nothing in front of him. He turns back to Quirrel.

SNAPE:
We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie. The door behind them slowly opens and closes... quietly, carefully... Filch appears, from around the corridor, walks up to Snape and Quirrel.

FILCH:
Professors... I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot.

SNAPE:
Then they can't be far. Snape, Quirrel and Filch exit.

HARRY:
Ah! Harry turns—as if expecting to see someone--but finds only the dark shapes of desks and chairs.. Slowly, he turns back.

HARRY:
Mum? Dad?

HARRY:
Ron! Ron! Wake up! Ron squints in confusion, then Harry lowers the cloak.

HARRY:
There's something you've got to see!

HARRY:
Come look! It's my family.

RON:
(yawning) That's you, Harry.

HARRY:
Look in properly, go on, stand here. Harry steps aside. Ron takes his place and...freezes.

HARRY:
There. You see them, don't you? That's—

RON:
Me. Only I'm...Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and...bloody hell...I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

HARRY:
(troubled) How can it? All my family are dead.

RON:
Want to play chess?

HARRY:
No.

RON:
Want to go visit Hagrid?

HARRY:
No.

RON:
Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about that mirror.

DUMBLEDORE:
Back again, Harry? Harry turns. Dumbledore slips off a desk, sits beside him.

DUMBLEDORE:
I see that you—like so many before you—have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I expect by now you realize what it does.

HARRY:
It shows me my family.

DUMBLEDORE:
And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy. Harry looks surprised. Dumbledore smiles.

DUMBLEDORE:
I don't need a cloak to become invisible. (re: the mirror)

HARRY:
So, then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want...

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them gathered around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his family, sees himself standing alone. Remember this, though, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it. Even gone mad. (rising) That's why it will be moved to a new home tomorrow. I ask that you do not go looking for it again, Harry. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.

HARRY:
Can I ask you something, Professor? What do you see when you look in the Mirror?

DUMBLEDORE:
I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. One can never have enough socks, Harry. You'll do well to remember that as well.

HERMIONE:
I'll ask you again. What are the three most Crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?

RON:
And I'll tell you again. I forgot.

HERMIONE:
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on final exams?

RON:
Crib off you.

HERMIONE:
You will not. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti cheating spell.

RON:
That's insulting. It's as if they don't trust us. (frowning) Dumbledore again. As Ron tosses the wizard card onto the table, HARRY WATCHES IT SPIN...just.as...a smattering of LAUGHTER erupts across the hall. Neville is HOPPING like a bunny, legs STUCK TOGETHER, while Seamus trails after. RON/HERMIONE Leg-Locker Curse. (and then to each other) Malfoy. Neville, breathing hard, reaches the Gryffindor table, then, before anyone can catch him, topples to the floor.

RON:
You’ve got to start standing up to him, Neville.

NEVILLE:
How? I can't stand up at all.

SEAMUS:
I offered to do the countercurse, but he wouldn't let me.

NEVILLE:
Of course not. That's all I need, you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire.

SEAMUS:
I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back. As Seamus turns away, the others see a curious BALD SPOT on the back of his head. Ron takes out his wand.

RON:
All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or...

HARRY:
I've found him. Ron stops, sees Harry holding up Dumbledore's wizard card. Ron takes it.

RON:
He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling. Harry rolls his eyes, turns the card over for Ron to READ.

RON:
'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood...and his work on alchemy...with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.'

HARRY:
I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.

HERMIONE:
Follow me.

NEVILLE:
Hey! Wait! What about that counter- curse! Neville1 eyes shift. Seamus smiles, raises an eyebrow.

HERMIONE:
How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

RON:
This is light?

HERMIONE:
Of course! Here it is! (whispers dramatically) Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone! Harry and Ron glance at each other, then Hermione. HARRY/RON The what?

HERMIONE:
Oh, honestly, don't you two read? (reading) ’The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will transform any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.'

RON:
Immortal.

HERMIONE:
It means you'll never die.

RON:
I know what it means—

HERMIONE:
’The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday.' (looking up) That's what Fluffy's guarding on the Third Floor. That's what's under the trapdoor. The Sorcerer's Stone!

HARRY:
So Flamel knows someone's after the Stone...gives it to Dumbledore to keep safe at Hogwarts...not realizing that the one who's after it...

HERMIONE:
Teaches at Hogwarts.

RON:
So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't? Hermione closes the book, troubled by something.

HARRY:
What is it, Hermione?

HERMIONE:
I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just...if all Snape wants is the Sorcerer's Stone...why did he try to kill you that day on the Quidditch pitch? Harry ponders this, but doesn't have an answer.

HAGRID:
Oh. Hullo. Er...not ter be rude, but I'm not really fit ter entertain right about--

HARRY:
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.

HAGRID:
Snape! Blimey, yer not still on abou' him, are yeh?

HARRY:
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know...why.

HAGRID:
Harry, Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. He's not abou' ter steal it.

HARRY:
What?

HAGRID:
Yeh heard me: Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. Now, as I said, I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment--

HARRY:
Wait a minute. One of the teachers?

HERMIONE:
Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments...

HAGRID:
Tha's right. Bloody waste o' time if yeh ask me. T'ain't no one goin' ter get past Fluffy. Not a soul knows how 'cept me an' Dumbledore— CRACK! A CLICKING SOUND is heard coming from the kettle, then a curious SCRAPING. Harry looks. Sees a HUGE BLACK EGG.

HARRY:
Hagrid...exactly what is that?

HAGRID:
Ah. Well. That's...er...

RON:
I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one?

HAGRID:
Won it. Off a stranger in the village. Think he was glad ter be rid of it, ter be honest.Blimey... The scraping is furious now. Quickly, Hagrid takes the egg from the kettle, sets it on a table. Fissures spread like veins over its surface, then it...EXPLODES... SHELL FLYING LIKE SHRAPNEL. Harry, Ron and Hermione cover themselves.

HERMIONE:
Is that...a dragon?

RON:
That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.

HAGRID:
Isn't he beautiful! Bless 'im, look, he knows 'is Mummy! (tickling the dragon's tummy) Hullo, Norbert.

HARRY:
Norbert?

HAGRID:
Well, he's got ter have a name. The dragon blinks at Hagrid, screws up its face and...SNEEZES, spewing forth a shower of SPARKS, which sends Fang whimpering and kindles a brief blaze in Hagrid's beard.

HAGRID:
Needs ter be trained up a bit, o' Course, (stopping cold) Hey, you there! All turn. Peering through the window is a FACE.

HARRY:
Malfoy! They leap to the door--see a fleet figure racing across the grounds, disappearing in the night.

HARRY:
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I ever met him.

RON:
But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy, knows.

HARRY:
I don't understand. Is that bad?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Miss Granger. Up ahead stands Professor McGonagall, a jagged silhouette in castle-light. Beside her, Draco Malfoy grins arrogantly.

RON:
It's bad.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
As every schoolchild knows, dragon breeding is against our laws, has been ever since the Warlock's Convention of 1709. And for good reason. It's hard to keep the Muggles from noticing us if we've got a thirty-foot Ukranian Ironbelly running around the back garden.

RON:
Norwegian Ridgeback. Professor Mcgonagall's eyes shift, narrow on Ron.

RON:
I just meant... in this case...sorry.

HARRY:
Fifty?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Each. And to insure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.

MALFOY:
Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Indeed. You see, Mr. Malfoy, however noble your intentions, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention.

FRED:
Don't worry, you three. This'll all blow over.

GEORGE:
It may take a year or two, but eventually people will start talking to you again.

HERMIONE:
(sniffing defensively)

RON:
Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it. All three peer at Malfoy. He raises a goblet in their direction, cackles with Crabbe and Goyle.

HERMIONE:
He won't be smiling tonight, (off Harry and Ron's looks) Haven't you heard? For detention they're taking us into the Dark Forest.

FILCH:
A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time, detention would find you all hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons...

FILCH:
A sorry lot this, Hagrid. I pity you. Filch squints, sees tears running down Hagrid's face.

FILCH:
Good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?

HAGRID:
(to Harry, Ron, Hermione)

HERMIONE:
Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Better all around, don't you think? Especially for Fang. Hearing his name, a singed Fang beats his BANDAGED tail.

HAGRID:
But what if Norbert doesn't like Romania. What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.

RON:
A baby that breaths fire. Harry elbows Ron, silencing him.

FILCH:
For god's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.

MALFOY:
The Forest? But I thought that was just a joke. We can't go in the Forest. Students aren't allowed. And there's...werewolves.

FILCH:
(turning away) Oh, there's more'n werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure o' that.

HAGRID:
Sorry abou’ this, Harry. Know it’s me that deserves punishin’, not you. By all rights I should be sittin’ in a cell in Azkaban tonight.

HARRY:
It’s all right, Hagrid. Besides, it’s not your fault we were out after hours. If we hadn’t come knocking on your door in the middle of the night— Abruptly Hagrid kneels, takes something onto his fingers.

HARRY:
(a bit warily) What’s that?

HAGRID:
The reason we’re here. (rising) All righ’ now, lis’en up. See this here? Hagrid holds up his fingers. They're marked with SILVER.

HAGRID:
It's unicorn blood. I found one dead a few weeks back and two before that first term. This one here's been hurt bad by summat. It's our job to find the poor thing. Only one way ter get that done and that's ter split inter two parties. Ron, Hermione—yeh'll come with me. Harry, yeh'll go with Malfoy.

MALFOY:
I want Fang then.

HAGRID:
Fine. But jus', so yeh know. He's a bloody coward.

MALFOY:
Wait until my father hears about this. This is servant stuff. We should be writing lines or...something.

MALFOY:
You're too stupid to be scared, Potter, growing up with Muggles. If you were from a real wizard family, you wouldn't be laughing.

HARRY:
I'm not, believe me... As Malfoy joins Harry, he stops dead. The trees ahead are striped violently with DRIPPING SILVER, and beyond—lying in a small clearing—is the broken body of a UNICORN. Fang backs off, something primal in his eyes. Harry watches Mm, reading hisfear, then..the SLITHERING SOUND returns. Seconds later, a HOODED FIGURE slithers over the leaves, drops its head over the leering WOUND on the unicorn's side...and begins to DRINK ITS BLOOD. MALFOY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Malfoy bolts, slipping and sliding as Fang whimpers after. Barry WINCES, clutches his scar, then sees that the Hooded Figure is staring directly at. him, silver dribbling down its front. Woozy from pain, Harry staggers back, then falls, the SLITHERING SOUND DRAWING CLOSER, when... HOOVES pummel the path behind him and some thing leaps clear over him, flickering past the moon above. It charges the hooded figure, drives it back into the trees...and away. A SHADOW FALLS across Harry's face. It is a CENTAUR with eyes like pale saphires. He is FIRENZE.

FIRENZE:
Harry Potter. You are known to many creatures here. You must leave. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.

HARRY:
What was that thing you saved me from?

HARRY:
But who would choose such a life?

FIRENZE:
Can you think of no one?

HARRY:
Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort!

FIRENZE:
Do you know whatis hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

HARRY:
The Sorcerer’s Stone. AND FOR THE UK AUDIENCE...

HARRY:
The Philosopher’s Stone... A commotion is heard as Hagrid and the others come slashing through the trees. As Harry reacts, the others break into the clearing.

HERMIONE:
Harry!

HAGRID:
Oh, it’s you, is it, Firenze. I see you’ve met our Mr. Potter. All right there, Harry? Harry nods...but he looks anything but all right.

RON:
You mean...You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest!

HARRY:
But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be strong again. He'll...come back.

RON:
But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to...kill you? Do you?

HARRY:
I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight. Ron looks vaguely sick.

RON:
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.

HERMIONE:
No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? (as they turn) Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe, Harry. As long as Dumbledore's around...you can't be touched.

HERMIONE:
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found that rather enjoyable. Weren’t you stunned not to be asked about Elfric the Eager?

RON:
I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry?

HARRY:
My scar. Keeps...burning.

HERMIONE:
It's happened before...

HARRY:
Not like this... Harry glances across the grounds at Hagrid, sitting in his front garden playing a FLUTE. At his feet, Fang's eyes droop.

HARRY:
No...

HERMIONE:
Harry? Harry starts across the grounds. Hermione and Ron glance at one another, rush after.

HARRY:
Don't you think it's a bit odd, that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon? And a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?

HAGRID:
Ne'er saw his face. Kept his hood up.

HARRY:
Didn't that strike you as unusual?

HAGRID:
Yeh meet a lot o' unusual types in the village. Ain't 'xactly usual meself.

HARRY:
This stranger, though. You and he must've talked...

HARRY:
And did he seem interested in Fluffy?

HAGRID:
Well, yeah. How many three-headed dogs do yeh meet, even if yeh're in the trade? So I tells 'im, this stranger, the trick with any beast is ter know what calms 'em. Take Fluffy, fer example. Jus' play 'im a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep-- Hagrid stops, horrified by his slip.

HAGRID:
I shouldn'ta tol' yeh that! Forget I said it! Hey! Where yeh goin'! Hey!

HARRY:
We have to see Professor Dumbledore. Immediately.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
I see. Well, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. Only moments ago, he received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off to London.

HARRY:
He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about...the Sorcerer's Stone. Professor McGonagall nearly drops the books in her hands.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
How do you know--

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Nonsense. I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is well protected. Now, run along.

HARRY:
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.

HERMIONE:
And with Dumbledore gone...

SNAPE:
Good afternoon. They freeze. Up ahead, Snape stands, studying them.

SNAPE:
Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such a lovely day?

HERMIONE:
We were just...

SNAPE:
You want to be careful. People will think you're...up to something. Snape eyes Harry, then turns away.

HERMIONE:
What do we do now?

HARRY:
Go through the trapdoor. Tonight.

RON:
Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here.

NEVILLE:
Neither should you. They all jump. Neville rises from an armchair.

NEVILLE:
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

HARRY:
Now, Neville, listen...

NEVILLE:
No! I won't let you. You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again. I'll...I'll fight you! You were the ones who told me I had to stand up to people!

RON:
To people. Not us. Neville raises his fists. Unfortunately, his teddy bear pyjamas somewhat undermine the intended effect.

HERMIONE:
Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this. (raising her wand) Petrificus Totalus! Instantly, Neville's arms and legs snap to his sides. He SWAYS...then FALLS FLAT...only his eyes moving, staring at them in horror. Harry and Ron look a little horrified too.

RON:
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary.

PEEVES:
Who's there? Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie? Nothing. Peeves smiles slyly, reaches back, and hurls one of the apples. It streaks through the air...then...disappears in mid-flight. Peeves smile fades.

PEEVES:
Never mind. He backpedals frantically, turns, and swoops off the way he came. Seconds later, Harry drops the cloak, tosses the APPLE in his hand to Ron.

HERMIONE:
That was close. Harry steps to the chamber before them. Inside, the thrum of MUSIC can be heard. Slowly, Harry starts to ease open the door...when... CRUNCH! Hermione and Harry jump, turn. Ron stands chewing the apple.

RON:
Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous. Harry pushes the door clear...finds...a giant quivering nose and yellow fangs dripping with saliva. They GASP, then...

RON:
Wait a minute. He's...

HARRY:
Snoring. Harry pushes the door further and the light from the corridor falls on a TINY HARP. Playing by itself.

RON:
Don't be stupid.

HERMIONE:
We're coming.

HARRY:
Right then. All together now. Straining mightily, they put their shoulders to the massive paw that lays across the trapdoor. Once done, Harry flings it open. Below lies only darkness...a faint whistling wind.

HARRY:
I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something...bad happens...get yourselves out— (stopping) Does it seem a bit...quiet...to you?

HERMIONE:
The harp...what happened to the— Splat! Something wet and sticky hits Ron's shoulder.

RON:
Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff— Slowly, they look up. A MONSTROUS, DROOLING SHADOW darkens their faces. Fluffy. Awake. Hungry. Each head ponders its own particular snack, then, with a mighty GROWL, swoops. Instantly, the trio pitches themselves into the darkness...

RON:
That was...cool.

RON:
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

HARRY:
WO! A vine snakes out Ron's back collar.

RON:
Wo! Twin creepers encircle Harry's chest.

HERMIONE:
Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil's Snare! You have to relax.

HARRY:
Uh, Hermione, it's a bit difficult to relax... (as a vine encircles his neck) ...given the circumstances.

HERMIONE:
I know, Harry. But you must. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster.

RON:
Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax. As they watch, Hermione takes a LONG, SLOW BREATH and...is SUCKED beneath the surface...VANISHING. HARRY/RON Hermione! Panicking, Harry and Ron begin to struggle anew, but the vines only wrap more tightly around them.

RON:
What are we going to do now!

HERMIONE:
Just relax.

HARRY:
(glancing about) Hermione? But how...where?

HARRY:
I suggest we do what she says. Harry takes a DEEP BREATH and closes his eyes. Slowly, like witch's fingers...the vines DRAW him beneath the surface.

HERMIONE:
He's not relaxing, is he? Ron's VOICE BELLOWS again.

HARRY:
Apparently not. Hermione furrows her brow, thinking ALOUD in a sing-song.

HERMIONE:
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...

RON:
Is she doing a poem? It's not possible she's doing a poem, is it?

HERMIONE:
It's deadly fun, but will...sulk in the sunl That's it! Light! Devil's Snare hates the light! She whips out her wand, points it at the vines hanging from the ceiling, and sends forth a BRIGHT BURST of GOLD.

RON:
Lucky we didn't panic.

HARRY:
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. Just then...they detect a SOUND: a RUSTLING, a CLINKING. The three exchange a glance, begin to descend the staircase.

HERMIONE:
What is that?

HARRY:
I don't know...sounds like wings.

HERMIONE:
Curious. I've never seen birds like these...

HARRY:
They're not birds... Ron and Hermione turn, see Harry standing by the floating broom in the center of the room, looking up.

HARRY:
They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. Hermione tests the doorknob, nods.

RON:
Alohomora! Hermione turns, sees Ron waving his wand at the knob. No good. It's still locked. He shrugs.

RON:
Well, it was worth a try.

HERMIONE:
(peering up) Sowhat do we do? There must be a thousand keys up there...

RON:
(examining the lock) We're looking for a big, old- fashioned one—probably silver, like the handle. There! That one, see! With the bright blue wings! Ron points. Fluttering within a pocket of brass keys is a larger, SILVER one.

HERMIONE:
What's wrong with its wing? RON. The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us. Hermione nods, sees Harry still staring at the broom.

HERMIONE:
Harry?

HARRY:
It's...too simple.

RON:
Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century. Harry nods uncertainly—still troubled—but slowly reaches out nonetheless. As his fingers touch the broomstick... ...the KEYS EXPLODE IN A FRENZY, hissing like wasps, swarming in great, glittering clouds. Ron's smile droops.

RON:
Well, this complicates things a bit. As Harry kicks into the air, a seething cluster of keys falls like HARD RAIN, CHATTERING at his arms and legs, SLICING at his skin, SHREDDING his sweater...

RON:
He'll be torn to pieces.. Horrified, Ron and Hermione watch Harry soar higher, fending off the keys with his free hand, until... HARRY'S POV Through a MAD CLATTERING, CLUSTER of KEYS, he spies the larger, silver one, fluttering only feet beyond his grasp. Harry hovers, grimacing as the hissing keys drop like DARTS onto his extended hand...then SNATCHES the silver key. Instantly, Harry whips downward in a wide, dizzying circle, trying to outrun the now furious keys. They shadow his every move, drawing closer and closer, HUMMING VICIOUSLY as they begin to CHIP at the TAIL TWIGS of the broom. Desperate, Harry throws the broom into a reckless dive and, steering with one hand... ...FLINGS the key to Ron. As Ron dashes to the door, Harry soars back up, taking the raging keys with him, then circles back and watches Ron JAM the key into the lock. As Hermione and Ron scurry through, Harry rockets straight after, the keys gaining once again, CHIPPING at the tail of broom like a buzzsaw through balsa wood. As the broom begins to WAFFLE, Harry gives one last BURST of SPEED and...SOARS through the open door. Together, Hermione and Ron FLING the door SHUT... just before the keys rain down like BULLETS.

HERMIONE:
I don't like this. I don't like this at all. A small bouquet of BLUE FLAMES blooms in Hermione's hands, illuminating little more than the trio's faces and some VAGUE SHAPES looming ahead.

HARRY:
Where are we? A graveyard?

RON:
This is no graveyard... Ron takes an unlit torch from the wall, touches it to the blue flames fluttering in Hermione's palms, and kneels. As he paints the floor with light, a SPARK SPITS from the torch and ignites a trail of FIRE.

RON:
It's a chessboard. Sure enough. As the chamber glows with light, a kind of battlefield is revealed, studded with faceless soldiers.

HERMIONE:
But what're we to do? As Hermione takes a tentative step onto the board, a BISHOP'S STONE SWORD drops heavily down, barring her way.

RON:
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play pur way across the room. Excuse me...are we meant to join you? (as the bishop nods) Brilliant. (to Harry, Hermione) Now don't be offended, but neither of you are particularly good at chess—

HARRY:
Just tell us what to do.

RON:
All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione— you'll be the Queenside castle. As for me... Ron leaps astride the only riderless horse.

RON:
...I'll be a Knight.

HERMIONE:
What happens now?

RON:
We play.

HERMIONE:
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you? Ron—contemplating something--doesn't answer immediately, instead gesturing to his own pawn.

RON:
You there...d5 As Ron's BLACK PAWN obliges, WHITE'S PAWN slides swiftly forth (to d5) and, with a THUNDEROUS collision, the black pawn EXPLODES, rubble raining to the ground.

RON:
Yes, Hermione? I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess. DISSOLVE TO: ...the chess board, a real battlefield now, littered on both sides with fallen pieces. Ron, drained but intense, surveys the board, MUTTERING to himself.

RON:
Think...Think. (deciding) Castle to ...c3 The BLACK CASTLE advances. Instantly, the WHITE QUEEN sweeps forward and, with cruel indifference, SHATTERS the Rook. Harry, only one square removed, stares with horror. Unnerved, he glances up at Ron, but Ron's eyes see only the board. Harry turns, taking a look himself...and blinks.

HARRY:
Wait a minute... (pointing to the Queen) She's made the same mistake I always make. If I go there, she has to take me, and the King is exposed! Ron nods, but it's clear he doesn't share Harry's enthusiasm.

HARRY:
No, Ron...

HERMIONE:
What is it?

HARRY:
He's going to sacrifice himself.

HERMIONE:
No. There has to be another way!

RON:
Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not! (turning to Harry) You understand, right, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then you're free to check the King. Harry stares at Ron—an understanding between them—then simply nods. Ron grips the reins then and, without a word, drives his horse forward (Nh3). Instantly, the White Queen POUNCES. As Ron hits the floor, Hermione SCREAMS. She starts to go to him, when Harry holds up his hand.

HARRY:
(AS SHE FREEZES)

HARRY:
(softly) Checkmate. As a veil of dust hovers, the white king removes his CROWN, lets it roll from his fingers, across the stone floor, where it comes to rest at Harry's feet. Harry stares at Hermione's stricken face.

HARRY:
If you can, go to the Owlery and send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on. Hermione turns, her eyes glittering. Without warning, she rushes forward, embraces Harry.

HERMIONE:
You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know!

HARRY:
(a bit embarrassed) Not as good as you.

HERMIONE:
Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things— friendship and bravery and—-oh, Harry, be careful! She turns then, goes to Ron. Harry studies his two friends, then looks away. The remaining chessmen bow, parting the way to the next door. He steps forward.

HARRY:
You! The figure turns. It is Professor Quirrell.

HARRY:
No. It can’t be. Snape...

QUIRRELL:
Mm, yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful Snape. Swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?

HARRY:
But that day, during the Quidditch match...Snape to kill me.

QUIRRELL:
No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. And, trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would've succeeded. Even with Severus muttering his little countercurse.

HARRY:
Snape was trying to save me?

QUIRRELL:
Oh, don't misunderstand. He hates you, just as he hated your father when they were at Hogwarts together. But he never wanted you dead. Your father, after all, saved his life once, long ago. Harry looks stunned. Quirrell looks amused.

QUIRRELL:
Didn't know? Surprising, given how curious you are Potter. I knew you were a danger to me right off. Especially after Halloween.

HARRY:
You let the Troll in. Quirrell nods, examining the Mirror as he speaks: QUIRRELL Yes. I have a way with trolls. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went straight to the Third Floor to head me off. That three headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. He, Of course, never trusted me again. Rarely left me alone,. But he doesn't understand. I am never alone. Never... (frowning) Now what does this mirror do? I see what I desire, I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it?

VOICE:
Use the boy. Harry glances about in horror as the DARK VOICE echoes. Quirrell turns, eyes Harry.

QUIRRELL:
Come here, Potter. Quirrell points to the mirror. As Harry steps in front, he sees himself, looking pale and scared. Then, slowly, his reflection SMILES, puts its hand in its pocket, and pulls out a BLOOD-RED STONE. Harry's own eyes widen—in a mixture of stunned disbelief and fear. Struggling to control his expression, he shuts his eyes briefly...as if making a wish...lets out a breath, and opens them once again. His reflection WINKS, returns the Stone to its pocket and, to Harry's amazement... ...it DROPS HEAVILY into his own: He's gotten the Stone.

QUIRRELL:
(studying him) What is it? What do you see?

HARRY:
I...I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.I...I've won the House Cup.

VOICE:
He lies.

QUIRRELL:
Tell the truth! What do you see!

VOICE:
Let me speak to him.

QUIRRELL:
Master, you are not strong enough.

VOICE:
I have strength enough...for this. Quirrell reaches up, unfurls his turban. In the mirror, Harry watches a FACE appear...on the back of Quirrell's head.

HARRY:
(in a whisper) Voldemort.

VOLDEMORT:
Harry Potter. We meet...again.

VOLDEMORT:
Yes. You see what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough...lies in your pocket. Harry wheels, dashing toward the staircase.

VOLDEMORT:
Stop him! Coolly, Quirrell SNAPS his fingers and, just as Harry reaches the threshold, FLAMES SHOOT from the floor, barring his way.

VOLDEMORT:
Don't be a fool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me...and live.

HARRY:
Never!

VOLDEMORT:
Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry...would you like to see your mother and father again? Harry stops, looks up. Quirrell steps aside, Voldemort's face sliding from the glass and revealing...Harry's parents.

VOLDEMORT:
Together, we can bring them back. All I ask...is for something in return. Slowly, almost involuntarily, Harry removes the Stone from his pocket.

VOLDEMORT:
That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just...give me the Stone. Harry studies his parents' faces, drifting to his mother's, when...we RACK FOCUS...and Voldemort's hideous face surfaces through her's...and she is gone.

HARRY:
Liar! Voldemort's eyes narrow.

VOLDEMORT:
Kill him. Instantly, Quirrell flies across the room, knocking Harry clean off his feet and the Stone tumbling from his grasp. Quirrell drops, his hand closing on Harry's neck. Harry winces at the touch, face creased in pain, looking up into Quirrell's face, when....for the briefest of moments—it becomes Voldemort's. Harry gasps, struggling, when—to his amazement—Quirrell's own face returns, SCREAMING, releasing Harry and recoiling.

QUIRRELL:
Wh-what is this magic? Harry, breathing hard, follows Quirrell's gaze, stares in horror: Quirrell's fingers are slowly turning to dust.

VOLDEMORT:
Fool! Get the Stone! Harry rises, looks at Quirrell's withering fingers, then to his own hands, healthy and whole. As Quirrell starts to move, Harry, in the flash of a second... ...decides. He bolts forward, reaches up with both hands and...presses them to Quirrell's face. Quirrell SCREAMS, but Harry holds tight, growing weaker as the face under his fingers begins to DISSOLVE until, finally, just when Harry looks ready to pass out... Quirrell's face drops away. Harry staggers back. Quirrell's body steps forward, blindly lurching towards Harry, and then...crumbles to dust. Harry stands still, just staring, then turns wearily, picks up the Stone, when...an APPARITION—bearing Voldemort's devilish face —SWOOPS up behind. Harry spins, watching in terror as... WHOOSH!—in a VIOLENT RUSH—Voldemort returns to DUST and WHISTLES FORWARD, passing through Harry, blasting him back -- through the air and onto the stone floor. As the dust disappears, all is quiet once more, and we CUT TO:

DUMBLEDORE:
Good afternoon, Harry. Harry squints, as if the card itself had spoken to him, then sees that the real Dumbledore is sitting on the windowsill. The great wizard slides off, gestures to the treats.

DUMBLEDORE:
Tokens from your admirers.

HARRY:
Admirers?

DUMBLEDORE:
What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret—so naturally the whole school knows. Your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. Though one suspects Agrippa and Ptolemy still elude him.

HARRY:
Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione--

DUMBLEDORE:
Fine. Both of them. Madame Pomfrey has explicitly forbidden visitors. But I think—with the help of a certain cloak— they've managed to monitor your progress.

HARRY:
But what happened to the—

HARRY:
But then, Flamel...he'll die, won't he?

DUMBLEDORE:
He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But, yes, he will die. To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible. But to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

HARRY:
But to destroy such a remarkable thing...

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes, yes. As much money and life as one could ever want—the two things most human beings would choose above all else. Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.

HARRY:
How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was stating in the mirror—

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone—find it, but not use it— would be able to get it. One of my more brilliant ideas and, between you and me, that's saying something.

HARRY:
Does that mean—with the Stone gone, that is—that Voldemort can never come back?

DUMBLEDORE:
I'm afraid there are other ways for him to return. And when—if—he does, it will take someone willing to fight a losing battle to stop him again. Someone like your parents. Someone like you.

HARRY:
(troubled) Professor Dumbledore. Voldemort said...if I gave him the Stone, he could bring back my...family. Could he have, sir? Really?

DUMBLEDORE:
Some people are like mirrors, Harry. They reflect our most desperate desires. We see what they want us to see. As painful as it surely was...you made the right choice. Harry nods. Dumbledore studies him thoughtfully.

DUMBLEDORE:
Do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to touch you, Harry? It's because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. Harry reaches up to his scar.

DUMBLEDORE:
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. It is the very thing someone like Professor Quirrell—full of hatred and greed—cannot understand. Or bear to touch.

HARRY:
What is it?

DUMBLEDORE:
Love, Harry. Love. Dumbledore looks away then, smiles at Harry's treats.

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee. (popping it) Alas! Ear wax!

HARRY:
All right there, Ron?

RON:
All right. You?

HARRY:
All right. Hermione? She smiles.

HERMIONE:
Never better.

RON:
D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen? And for you to do it? Sending you your father's cloak and all?

HERMIONE:
Well, if he did—I mean—that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come to think of it, I could've been killed...

HARRY:
I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only thing I don't understand is Snape...

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Professor Snape, Potter. Harry looks up, sees Professor McGonagall there.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
They were not compatible personalities, if that's what you mean. And then, of course, your father did something Severus could never forgive.

HARRY:
What was that?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
He saved his life. Astonished, Harry glances at Snape sitting at the High Table.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
I suppose he felt it his obligation ...to look after you this year.

RON:
Of course! And now that he's squared things, he can hate Harry in peace, right, Professor?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Hogwarts teachers do not hate their students, Mr. Weasley... (pointedly, as she exits) No matter how taxing they may be. R0N I think she's warming up to me. At the High Table, Dumbledore rises and the Hall quiets.

DUMBLEDORE:
Another year gone! Now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus: tn fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312. Percy turns and glares at Ron.

RON:
You'd think saving the bloody school from a Dark Lord would count for something.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes, well done, Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. I have a few last minute points to award. The hall goes very STILL. The Slytherin smiles FADE a bit.

DUMBLEDORE:
First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril... fifty points. As the Gryffindors cheer, Hermione looks overwhelmed.

DUMBLEDORE:
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years...fifty points..

PERCY:
My youngest brother, you know!

DUMBLEDORE:
Third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House...sixty points. The DIN is deafening as Hermione makes the calculations.

HERMIONE:
Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin!

DUMBLEDORE:
And finally...it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but even more to stand up to our friends. I therefore award 10 points to...Mr. Neville Longbottom.

DUMBLEDORE:
Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe a change of decoration is in order. umbledore CLAPS his hands and--instantly—the green and silver of Slytherin-become the scarlet and gold of Gryffindor. Neville, white with shock, disappears under a pile of people hugging him. Draco Malfoy, looks stunned and horrified. Snape, with a horrible, forced smile, shakes Professor McGonagall's hand, then catches Harry's eye, his hatred still evident, but not enough to mar the moment. Harry considers the cheering faces’ that surround him, alone in the eye of a happy huricane. For a moment, he is not part of them, just watching. Then his voice joins the others, his face saying it all... This is a long way from the cupboard under the stairs.

RON:
Come on now, Harry. Harry glances about once more, then starts for the train.

HAGRID:
Didn' think yeh'd be leavin' without sayin' goodbye, didya? Harry stops, smiles as Hagrid comes loping forward. Hagrid hands him a LEATHER-COVERED BOOK.

HAGRID:
That there's fer you to open on the train. Which seems to be leavin', by the way. Harry holds out his hand. Hagrid takes it, then pulls him into a rough hug.

HAGRID:
Go on now. An' Harry? If tha' dolt of a cousin o' yers Dudley gives yeh any grief, yeh can always threaten ter give 'im a pair o' ears ter go with that tail of 'is.

HARRY:
But Hagrid. We're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.

HAGRID:
I do... (a wink) But yer cousin don't.

HERMIONE:
Feels strange, doesn' t it? To be going home. Harry traces his finger over the smiling face of his mother, then looks up, following Hermione's gaze to the window.

HARRY:
I'm not going home...Not really.

PULL AWAY:
...rising high above Hogsmeade Station, above the Dark Forest and Hogwarts Castle itself as the Scarlet Express glitters far below, making its way back to the Muggle world. Slowly, we...

HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

HARRY:
I can't, Hedwig.	I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.

UNCLE VERNON:
Har-ry Pot-ter!

HARRY:
Now you've done it.

UNCLE VERNON:
I warned you.	If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

HARRY:
She's bored.	If I could just let her out for an hour or two --

UNCLE VERNON:
And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends?	No, sir.

DUDLEY:
Who'd want to be friends with you?

UNCLE VERNON:
I should think you'd be more grateful.	We raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of the goodness of our hearts.

DUDLEY:
I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs. AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the pudding.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Not yet, popkin.	That's for when the Masons arrive.

UNCLE VERNON:
Which should be any moment.	Now. Let's run through our schedule one more time.	Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be --

AUNT PETUNIA:
In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.

UNCLE VERNON:
Good.	And Dudley?

DUDLEY:
I'll be waiting to open the door.

UNCLE VERNON:
Excellent. (turning on Harry) And you?

HARRY:
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.

UNCLE VERNON:
Too right you will.	With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. DOORBELL RINGS.	Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out of the kitchen and into the hallway.

UNCLE VERNON:
Upstairs!	Hurry!

DOBBY:
Harry Potter!	Such an honor it is! (CONTINUED)

DOBBY:
Dobby, sir.	Dobby the house elf.

HARRY:
I see.	Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

DOBBY:
Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin.

HARRY:
Why don't you sit down?

DOBBY:
S-s-sit down? Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS.	LOUD TEARS.	Harry panics.

HARRY:
Shhhh!	I'm sorry.	I didn't mean to offend you or anything --

DOBBY:
Offend Dobby!	Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal...

HARRY:
You can't have met many decent wizards then. Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.

DOBBY:
Bad Dobby!	Bad Dobby! 7	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY	7 Uncle Vernon pours champagne for MR. and MRS. MASON.	As Dobby's HEAD BANGING sounds from above, all eyes shift to the ceiling.	Uncle Vernon chuckles nervously.

UNCLE VERNON:
Don't mind that.	It's just the... cat.

DUDLEY:
Cat?	What cat?

UNCLE VERNON:
Our cat, tiger. 8	INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY	8 Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning dizzily.	Harry regards him with a mixture of concern... and wariness.

HARRY:
Are you... all right?

DOBBY:
Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.

HARRY:
Your... family?

DOBBY:
The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.	Dobby is bound to serve one family forever.	If they ever knew Dobby was here... Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.

DOBBY:
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. (in a fierce whisper) Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

HARRY:
Not go back?	But... I have to.

DOBBY:
This is a plot.	A plot to make most terrible things happen.	If Harry Potter goes back to school he will be in great danger.

HARRY:
What terrible things?	Who's plotting them? Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.

HARRY:
Okay!	I understand.	You can't say -- Too late.	Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.

UNCLE VERNON:
They arrive at the ninth hole and!-- DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above. MR. MASON Sounds as if that cat of yours has dragged something in with it, Dursley.

UNCLE VERNON:
Not to worry.	I'll sort it out. 10	INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY	10 Harry wrestles the lamp away from Dobby.

HARRY:
Stop!	Stop! FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing.	Quickly, Harry grabs Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.

UNCLE VERNON:
What the devil are you doing up here!	You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke.	One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR. Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe.

HARRY:
See why I've got to go back?	I don't belong here.	I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts.	It's the only place I've got... friends.

DOBBY:
Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?

HARRY:
Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me? Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.

DOBBY:
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...

HARRY:
Give me those.	Now. Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door. Panicking...

HARRY:
Dobby... Please... No...

DOBBY:
Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.

HARRY:
I can't.	Hogwarts is my home.

DOBBY:
(a tragic expression) Then Dobby must do it, sir.	For Harry Potter's own good. Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS.	The pudding PLUMMETS... straight onto the Masons.	They stand blinking, covered head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets.	The Masons exit.	Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after them.

UNCLE VERNON:
I'm sorry.	It's our nephew.	Very disturbed.	Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...

AUNT PETUNIA:
We have ice cream... The Masons get into their car and drive off, just as a SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky.	An OWL SWOOPS down, and DROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's feet.	He picks up the letter, opens it.	As he reads it, a mad gleam dances in Uncle Vernon's eye.	He turns and races back inside the house.	Aunt Petunia follows.

UNCLE VERNON:
Go on.	Read it.

HARRY:
'Dear Mr. Potter.	We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening.	As you know, underage wizards...'

UNCLE VERNON:
'... are not permitted to perform spells outside school.' (MORE)

UNCLE  VERNON:
(snatching the letter) You didn't tell us you weren't Allowed to use magic at home. Slipped your mind, didn't it? (MORE) (CONTINUED)

UNCLE  VERNON:
Well, I've got news for you, boy. I'm locking you up!	And if you try to magic yourself out, they'll expel you!	You're never going back to that school!		Never! 12	EXT./INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY	12 A SHORT MONTAGE BEGINS: Uncle Vernon fits IRON BARS to the inside of Harry's window. Drills a METAL FLAP to the base of the bedroom door. Fits a FAT, GREY LOCK to the door itself.	Soaking with sweat, he casts Harry a nasty grin and pulls shut the DOOR.	It closes with the DULL CLANK of a cell. 13	INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	13 Harry stares gloomily out the window.	The METAL FLAP RATTLES and Dudley's pudgy hand slides a BOWL of TINNED SOUP onto the floor.	He grins cruelly through the opening.

DUDLEY:
I know what day it is.

HARRY:
Well done, Dudley.	Finally learned the days of the week, have you.

DUDLEY:
Today's your birthday.	And nobody cares. Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap.	Harry sighs, takes the soup and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig.

HARRY:
It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got. Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we... DISSOLVE TO:

HARRY:
Ron?

RON:
Hiya, Harry.

HARRY:
Fred?	George?	What're you doing here?

RON:
Rescuing you, of course.	Where's your trunk?

RON:
Stand back. Harry steps back.	Ron turns, nods to Fred.

UNCLE VERNON:
Petunia!	He's getting away! As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle.	Harry tumbles into the darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible second. Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls harder.	Ron braces himself, pulls back.	Harry hangs, stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled steel bars. CLOSEUP:	Harry's hand begins to slip from Ron's fingers. INSIDE OF CAGE:	Hedwig PECKS feverishly at the LOCK. CLOSE-UP:	Ron.	PANICKED.

RON:
Hold on, Harry!

UNCLE VERNON:
Oh no, boy!	You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere! CLOSE-UP:	Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's. INSIDE OF CAGE:	Hedwig PECKS HARDER and... the CAGE OPENS. Hedwig SWOOPS into the sky, WHEELS BACK and hammers her beak into Uncle Vernon's hand. He ROARS, stumbles back and... Ron and George pull Harry into the air.

RON:
Put your foot down, Fred!

RON:
By the way, Harry.	Happy Birthday. DISSOLVE TO: 18	EXT. THE BURROW - EARLY MORNING	18 As the Anglia drops through a pink sky, a haphazard mess of a HOUSE, built around a towering central chimney, appears below.	By the road, a lopsided SIGN reads:	THE BURROW.	FLUMPH!	The car touches down in a WHIRLING CONE of dust, scatters a group of chickens, and fishtails to a halt.	The boys spill quickly out of the car.	FRED WHISPERS urgently.

FRED:
Hurry!	Let's nip inside before Mum wakes up! 19	INT. FRONT ROOM - THE BURROW - MOMENTS LATER	19 The boys sneak inside, gently close the door.	Harry stops.	Magical objects surround him:	A CLOCK displays different chores for each family member.	A pair of NEEDLES knit a sweater by themselves.	And a stack of PLAYING CARDS that.	A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLE themselves, providing a cooling breeze for Ron's aging rat, SCABBERS.	Ron shrugs, averts his eyes self- consciously.

RON:
It's not much.

HARRY:
I think it's... brilliant! Ron looks up.	Sees Harry's mesmerized face.	Slowly... GRINS. MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.) WHERE... HAVE... YOU... BEEN?! The boys nearly jump out of their skin.	MRS. WEASLEY stands in the doorway.	Furious.	She smiles sweetly at Harry.

RON:
They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window! MRS. WEASLEY You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! (softening instantly) Care for a spot of tea, Harry?

GINNY:
Mummy.	Have you seen my jumper -- A small, RED-HEADED GIRL appears.	Sees Harry.	And... SQUEALS.	Dashes back up the stairs.	Ron frowns.

RON:
Ginny.	Been talking about you all summer.	Dead annoying, really.

GEORGE:
Dad's home! The front door OPENS and ARTHUR WEASLEY enters.	A tall man with red hair, his robes look dusty and travel-worn. MR. WEASLEY What a night!	Nine raids!	Nine!

HARRY:
(to Ron) Raids?

RON:
Dad works at the Ministry of Magic.	In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.

HARRY:
The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?

RON:
That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing.	Dad loves Muggles.	Thinks they're fascinating. Mr. Weasley hangs up his cloak, turns.	Blinks. MR. WEASLEY Well  now.	Who are you?

RON:
Harry, sir.	Harry Potter. MR. WEASLEY Good Lord, are you really? Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did you get here? MRS. WEASLEY (darkly) This morning.	Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey house and back last night. MR. WEASLEY Did you now!	How'd it go?! (catching his wife's eye) I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys.	Very wrong indeed. So, Harry.	You must know all about Muggles.	Tell me, what exactly is the function of a parking meter? Harry is about to answer, when he notices an OWL (ERROL) soaring toward the kitchen window.	To Harry's horror, the owl doesn't pull up.	It just flies... SMACK!.	into the glass. MRS. WEASLEY That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George? George takes the unconscious Errol, absently lays him on a draining board, and takes the LETTERS clutched in his claws.

GEORGE:
It's our Hogwarts letters!	And look.	They've sent Harry's as well.

FRED:
(reading his) This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spellbooks alone... MRS. WEASLEY We'll manage.	Right then. There's only one place to get all of this.

RON:
Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.

HARRY:
Floo Powder? Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters. MRS. WEASLEY Percy.	Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done?

PERCY:
Certainly, Mother.	Don't worry, Harry.	It's simple enough.

PERCY:
Diagon Alley. Percy VANISHES.	Tentatively, Harry reaches into the pot. MRS. WEASLEY Remember to speak clearly, dear!

RON:
And mind you get out at the right grate!

HARRY:
(nodding, unsure) D-Dia-gon Alley! 25	INT. SPIRALING TUNNEL	25 The SOUND is DEAFENING as Harry hurtles forward, squinting against the sting of WHIRLING SOOT and the mad, flickering lights of passing fireplaces.	He falls face forward... 26	INT. BORGIN AND BURKES - STONE FIREPLACE - DAY	26 ... onto a stone hearth.	Dizzy and dirty, Harry reclaims his shattered glasses.	He's tumbled into a wizard's shop, but a decidedly creepy one.	He starts to exit, when a WITHERED HAND in a GLASS CASE catches his eye: The Hand of Glory.	Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams: Caution:	Do not touch.	Cursed--Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.	Oddly transfixed by it all, Harry drifts toward the exit, when... (CONTINUED)

LUCIUS MALFOY:
I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. But selling.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call. Certain poisons and the like... MR. BORGIN Hmmm... yes.	I see... INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING IN.	His eyes shift upward.	The ceiling is DROPPING. Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when... the HAND GRABS HIM.	Draco shrieks, manages to slip free, then calms.	He eyes the hand with malicious glee.

DRACO:
Can I have this?

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin. Though if his marks don't pick up --

DRACO:
It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. That Hermione Granger --

LUCIUS MALFOY:
I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam. MR. BORGIN It's the same all over.	Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
(deadly) Not with me. INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry's knees are up under his chin... Borgin checks off one last time, then returns the parchment to Lucius.	Satisfied, Malfoy nods.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Very good.	I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow.	Come, Draco. They exit.	As Borgin slips into the back room, the Crushing Cabinet's doors FLY OPEN and Harry leaps free. Inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling SNAP SHUT!	Borgin reappears, blinks curiously at Harry, then watches him RACE out the door. 27	EXT. KNOCKTURN ALLEY - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)	27 Once outside, Harry fits his broken glasses to his face, eyes a STREET SIGN:	"KNOCKTURN ALLEY."

AGED WITCH:
Not lost are you, my dear? Harry wheels, looking into the mossy teeth of a decrepit WITCH.	She holds a tray of HUMAN FINGERNAILS.

HARRY:
I'm fine, thanks.	I'm just --

HAGRID:
HARRY!	What d'yer think yer doin' down 'ere?

HAGRID:
Yer a mess!	Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley.	Dodgy place, Harry.	Don't want no one ter see yeh down there.	People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good.

HARRY:
I was lost, I -- Hang on.	What were you doing down there?

HAGRID:
I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' the school cabbages.

HERMIONE:
Harry! Harry looks up, sees HERMIONE GRANGER standing at the top of Gringotts' white steps.	She runs down to meet them.

HERMIONE:
Hello, Hagrid.	Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again. She stops then, cocks her head curiously at Harry, then takes out her wand and points it directly between his eyes.

HERMIONE:
Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.

HARRY:
I need to remember that one.

HERMIONE:
C'mon.	Everyone's been so worried. Hermione leads them to Gringotts, where Hermione's rather nervous-looking Muggle parents stand with the Weasleys. MR. WEASLEY So you're dentists!	Fascinating! I understand other Muggles quite fear you?	Why is that? MRS. WEASLEY Oh, Harry.	Thank goodness.	We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.	Come now.	We're off to Flourish and Blotts.

HERMIONE:
Isn't it thrilling!	Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there!	We can actually meet him!	I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.

HARRY:
Who?

RON:
Mum fancies him. For this, Mrs. Weasley gives Ron a jab in the shoulder. A SHORT MAN WITH A CAMERA bumps past.

SHORT MAN:
Out of the way!	This is for The Daily Prophet! Instantly, Lockhart looks up, flashes a smile, when...

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
It can't be Harry Potter? The crowd WHISPERS excitedly as Lockhart dives forward, seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the photographer.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
(under his breath) Nice big smile, Harry.	Together, you and I rate the front page. (as the CAMERA FLASHES) Ladies and gentlemen!	What an extraordinary moment this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me -- which, incidentally is celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop The Daily Prophet's Bestseller List -- he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works! Free of charge!

HARRY:
Thank you. Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's cauldron.

HARRY:
You have these.	I'll buy my own!--

DRACO:
(appearing, sneers) Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?	Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.

GINNY:
Leave him alone!	He didn't want all that!

DRACO:
Look, Potter.	You've got yourself a girlfriend! (CONTINUED)

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Silence, Draco!	Ah	Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met. Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shake Harry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over the fringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLT SCAR.	At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Forgive me, Mr. Potter.	But your scar is legend.	As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.

HARRY:
He was a murderer.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past.	Surely, you don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named is gone forever.

HARRY:
His name is Voldemort. Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
You must be very brave, Mr. Potter, to dare speak his name. Or foolish.

HERMIONE:
Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring defiantly.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
You must be Miss Granger.	Draco's told me all about you... and your parents.	Muggles, aren't you? Mr. and Mrs. Granger nod nervously. Lucius Malfoy can barely disguise his distaste for them. Arthur Weasley hurries over.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Obviously not.	Dear me.	What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it. MR. WEASLEY We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
(glancing at the Grangers) Clearly.	The company you keep, Weasley.	And I thought your family could sink no lower. Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy.	Hagrid steps forward, puts a firm hand on Mr. Weasley's shoulder.

HAGRID:
Ignore 'im, Arthur. Mr. Weasley backs away.	Lucius Malfoy tosses Ginny's BATTERED TEXTBOOK back into her cauldron.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Here, girl.	Take your book.	It's the best your father can give you. Lucius and Draco exit.	Hagrid looks at the Weasleys.

HAGRID:
No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter. Rotten ter the core, the whole family... As Harry watches Draco and his father go, we -- DISSOLVE TO:

RON:
We better hurry. Harry nods, leans into his trolley and -- CRASH! -- hits the barrier and bounces back into Ron.	A  GUARD  glowers.

GUARD:
What in blazes d'you two think you're doing?

HARRY:
Sorry.	Lost control of the trolley. (to Ron) Why can't we get through?

RON:
I dunno.	The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. As Ron presses his ear to the barrier, the CLOCK CHIMES.

HARRY:
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock.	We've missed it.

RON:
Can't hear a thing. (a sudden thought) Harry.	If we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

HARRY:
Maybe we should go wait by the car.

HARRY:
This is mad.	We can't drive to Hogwarts.

RON:
Who says we're driving?

HARRY:
You don't mean -- Ron, no.

RON:
Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back.	And we've got to get to school, haven't we?	And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency.	Least that's what Fred and George always say...

HARRY:
Something tells me we're going to regret this.

HARRY:
No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this.

RON:
No problem. Ron SHIFTS.	With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the ground.

RON:
There.	See.	Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it.	Simple. Harry nods, not entirely convinced.	He peers out the window.	Down below, TWO PEDESTRIANS stare in disbelief.

HARRY:
Uh, Ron.	I should tell you.	Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.

RON:
Right. Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and they... DISAPPEAR.	Down below, the baffled pedestrians blink.

RON:
Uh oh.	The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff.	The car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.

RON:
Any sign of the train?

HARRY:
There!	Up ahead!	Look... Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS appear.

RON:
It must be around here someplace. Behind them, through the Anglia's rear window, the Hogwarts Express APPEARS, closing fast.	Harry and Ron perk up.	Smile.

HARRY:
Do you hear that? Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron register the DIRECTION of the sound.	They glance at each other, turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the rear window.

RON:
Take my hand! Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far below.	It's quite a drop.	Harry's fingers begin to LOSE THEIR GRIP.

HARRY:
I think we found the train. 35	EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FLYING CAR - NIGHT	35 As HOGWARTS CASTLE comes INTO VIEW, the Anglia ENTERS FRAME.

RON:
Welcome  home,  Harry. Harry smiles at the sight of it, when... the Anglia GROANS.

HARRY:
Just out of interest, Ron.	Have you ever landed a car before?

RON:
Well... no.	but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either. With that, the car LURCHES, the nose DROPS, and...

RON:
Uh oh.

HARRY:
UP!	UP! Ron SHIFTS desperately.	The Anglia LURCHES up, barely clears the castle wall.	Harry and Ron exchange a look of relief, when... the car GROANS again, LURCHES... downward. HARRY MIND THAT TREE! Down below a GIANT WILLOW TREE looms.	Ron SHIFTS. Nothing.

RON:
My wand!	Look at my wand!

HARRY:
Be thankful it's not your neck. THWUNMP!	Something HEAVY HITS Harry's door, sends a SHUDDER through the car.

RON:
What's  happening? Slowly, they look up and, in disbelief, watch one of the tree's branches PULL BACK, CURL INTO ITSELF, and come LASHING FORWARD like a MASSIVE FIST.	THWUMP!

RON:
What kind of tree is this? Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like popcorn.	WINDOWS SHATTER.	Heavy DENTS appear on the roof above Ron and Harry's heads.	Then the car FALLS again... ... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND.	Instantly, the tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR BACK AND FORTH.

HARRY:
Reverse!	Reverse! Ron SHIFTS, the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS, and the willow PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated. Safely clear, the doors fly open, the seats tip sideways, and Ron and Harry are ejected.	As they hit the ground, their trunks fly from the boot, Hedwig's cage rockets out the back window, and Hedwig herself flaps into the night. Taillights blazing angrily, the BATTERED car speeds off, fishtailing into the Dark Forest.

RON:
Dad's going to kill me. They hear a TREMENDOUS GROAN, turn back, and see the Whomping Willow assume its natural form, waiting for its next victim. 36	EXT. STONE STEPS/ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT	36 Filthy and bruised, Harry and Ron drag themselves up the steps.	Behind them we see the mountain of student trunks and caged pets already brought up from the train.

HARRY:
A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.

FILCH:
Well, take a good look, lads... They stop.	ARGUS FILCH stands at the top of the landing, his cat -- MRS. NORRIS -- twitching her tail at his feet.

FILCH:
This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.

SNAPE:
You were seen!	By no less then seven Muggles.	 Do you have any idea how serious this is?	You have risked the exposure of our world.	Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years.

RON:
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.

SNAPE:
Silence!	I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight.	As it is --

HARRY:
Professor Dumbledore.	Professor McGonagall...

SNAPE:
Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE:
I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself.	However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.

RON:
(rising gloomily) We'll go and get our stuff. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?

RON:
Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Not today, Mr. Weasley.	But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be sending owls to both of your families tonight.	And you will each get a detention. Snape casts a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron.

DUMBLEDORE:
Splendid.	Now, I suggest we return to the feast.	There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor.	Taking it, he reads the back:	"KWIKSPELL.	A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN BEGINNER'S MAGIC."	It's addressed to "MR. ARGUS FILCH."

HARRY:
Mr. Filch.	You  dropped  this... Filch turns, eyes the envelope with embarrassment, then snatches it from Harry's hand and stuffs it into his pocket.

NEVILLE:
Detention.	On the first day?

SEAMUS:
That must be some kind of record.

HERMIONE:
I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.

RON:
I should think you'd mind your own business. They glare at each other.	PROFESSOR SPROUT, a squat little witch, TAPS her wand on a stack of POTS.

PROFESSOR SPROUT:
Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years.	Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes.	Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?	Yes, Miss Granger.

HERMIONE:
Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured to their original state.	It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

PROFESSOR SPROUT:
Excellent.	Ten points to Gryffindor.		As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet.	However, they will knock you out for several hours. That is why I have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would then... Ron frowns.		He's gotten a BRIGHT PINK FLUFFY pair.	When the class is ready, Professor Sprout leads them to the GARDEN AREA.	She grasps one of the TUFTY PLANTS before her... and pulls.	Harry gasps.	Instead of roots, a small, muddy, extremely ugly BABY pops out of the earth, leaves growing right out of its head.	Neville's eyes ROLL BACK.	He FAINTS. Professor Sprout plunges the BAWLING CREATURE deep into a POT, removes her earmuffs, and the others follow suit. Everyone save Neville, who lies stretched on the ground.

PROFESSOR SPROUT:
Hm.	Looks as though Mr. Longbottom neglected his muffs.

SEAMUS:
No, ma'am.	He's just fainted.

PROFESSOR SPROUT:
Very well.	We'll just leave him then.	Come now.	Four to a tray, plenty of pots to go round... 41	INT. GREAT HALL - LUNCH - DAY	41 Percy enters in the company of PENELOPE CLEARWATER, just as NEARLY HEADLESS NICK glides by.

PENELOPE CLEARWATER:
There's Nearly Headless Nick.

PERCY:
Hello, Sir Nicolas.

NEARLY HEADLESS NICK:
Hello, Percy.	Miss Clearwater. At the Gryffindor table, Hermione has her nose buried in Gilderoy Lockhart's Travels with Trolls.	Ron runs gobs of Spellotape over his BROKEN WAND, shakes his head grimly.

RON:
Say it.	I'm doomed.

HARRY:
You're doomed. FLASH! -- a LIGHT BLINDS Harry.	He blinks, finds a small boy (COLIN CREEVEY) standing before him with a CAMERA.

COLIN:
Hiya, Harry.	I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

HARRY:
Hello, Colin.	Nice to meet --

COLIN:
They're for my dad -- the pictures.	He's a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like all our family's been until me.	No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got my letter from Hogwarts.	Everyone just thought I was mental.

RON:
Imagine that.

COLIN:
Say, Harry.	D'you think your friend could take a photo of me and you standing together?	Ya' know, to prove I've met you? Harry glances at Ron.	He looks positively homicidal. Mercifully, just then, OWLS STREAM into the Hall.

DEAN THOMAS:
Post is here! One after another, the birds swoop gracefully down, clutching letters from home.	All except one, who plops beak-first into Ron's soup.	Errol.

RON:
Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.

SEAMUS:
Heads up, everyone.	Weasley's gotten himself a Howler. (CONTINUED)

NEVILLE:
Go on, Ron.	I ignored one from my Gran once... and it was horrible. Ron looks pale.	Clutched in Errol's beak is a DAMP RED ENVELOPE.	Hands shaking, he takes it, opens it, and... MRS. WEASLEY'S VOICE THUNDERS, sending plates and spoons rattling. MRS. WEASLEY (V.O.) RONALD WEASLEY!	HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!	I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!	YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!	IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! (softening suddenly) Oh, and Ginny dear. Congratulations on making Gryffindor.	Your father and I are so proud. Ginny, sitting a bit apart from the others, looks up shyly, then returns to the SMALL BLACK BOOK she's scribbling in.		Ron watches the envelope RIP ITSELF TO PIECES, then endures HOWLS of LAUGHTER from the other House tables.	Colin Creevey snaps a few photos.	Harry looks sympathetically at Ron.

HARRY:
Look at it this way.	How much worse can things get?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher.	Me.	Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But I don't talk about that.	I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her! Lockhart awaits laughter.	A few students smile weakly.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I see you've all bought a complete set of my books.	Well done.	I thought we'd start today with a little quiz.	Nothing to worry about.	Just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in... Lockhart begins to circulate papers.	Harry and Ron examine the questions.	Ron WHISPERS to Harry.

RON:
Look at these questions.	They're all about him.

HARRY:
'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?'

RON:
'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'

HARRY:
'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday and what would his ideal gift be?'

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
You have thirty minutes.	Start -- now! As quills begin to dart across pages, we -- DISSOLVE TO:

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Tut, tut.	Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac.	But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl. Hermione beams.	Lockhart's expression suddenly darkens.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Now... be warned!	It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here... With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I must ask you not to scream.	It might provoke them. A pale Neville draws back.	Harry and Ron lean forward. Lockhart lets the tension build, then WHIPS off the cover.	Inside the cage are several electric blue CREATURES.	Eight inches tall, with pointed faces and wings, they rattle the bars and pull bizarre faces at the students.

SEAMUS:
Cornish pixies?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.	Let's see what you make of them now! Lockhart flings open the cage.	Instantly, the pixies rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles, BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books.	Two SEIZE Neville by the ears, lift him into the air, and begin to circle the ceiling.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Come on now, round them up, round them up.	They're only pixies. (brandishing his wand) Peskipiski Pesternomi! The spell has absolutely no effect.	A particularly obnoxious pixie makes a face, seizes Lockhart's wand and tosses it out the window.	Lockhart joins the stampede to the door.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. SLAMMING the door, he's gone.	Harry, Ron and Hermione stand blinking.	Ron swats a pixie gnawing his ear.

RON:
What do we do now?

HERMIONE:
(raising her wand) Immobilus! The pixies FREEZE IN MIDAIR.	Neville falls, PLOPS onto Lockhart's desk, shaken but unhurt.	He looks at Hermione.

NEVILLE:
Why is it always me?

RON:
Can you believe him?

HERMIONE:
I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.

HARRY:
Hands on?	Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing.

HERMIONE:
Rubbish.	Read his books.	You'll see all the amazing things he's done.

RON:
He says he's done. 43	OMITTED	43 &	& 44	44

WOOD:
I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're going to train earlier, harder, and longer! (squinting) What the... I don't believe it! Crossing the courtyard from the other side are SEVEN BOYS in GREEN ROBES, also carrying broomsticks.	At their lead is MARCUS FLINT, trollish Slytherin Captain.	Ron,  sitting at a table with Hermione, looks up. (CONTINUED)

RON:
Uh-oh.	I smell trouble.

WOOD:
Clear out, Flint!	I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.

FLINT:
Easy, Wood.	I've got a note. As Wood snatches the PARCHMENT from Flint's hand, Ron and Hermione come up to join the others.

WOOD:
'I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.' (looking up) You've got a new Seeker?	Who? A pasty-faced boy pushes to the front.	It's	Malfoy.

HARRY:
Draco?

DRACO:
That's right.	And that's not all that's new this year... As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS.	The Gryffindors look stunned.

RON:
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.

FLINT:
A generous gift from Draco's father.

DRACO:
That's right, Weasley.	You see, unlike some, my father can afford to buy the best.

HERMIONE:
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.

DRACO:
No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. Everyone reacts as if Malfoy has said something horrific -- everyone save Harry, who looks puzzled.	Instantly, Fred and George fly for Draco's throat.	Oliver Wood holds them back.

WOOD:
Save it for the match.

RON:
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! (whips out his wand) Eat slugs! Ron points his cracked wand at Malfoy.	PFFT! -- a BOLT of GREEN LIGHT scissors out the wrong end, hitting Ron himself in the stomach.	As he drops to the grass, Hermione runs to him

HERMIONE:
Ron!	Say something! Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES.	Hermione draws back, and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth.	The Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER.	Angrily, Ron rises, only to BELCH again.	Fascinated, Colin Creevey runs up with his camera.

COLIN:
Wow!	Can you hold him still, Harry?!

HARRY:
Get out of the way, Colin! (to Hermione) Let's take him to Hagrid.	He'll know what to do. 46	INT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY	46 Hagrid rummages about, looking for something.

HAGRID:
Got jus' the thing.	Set 'im down on that chair o'er there. As Ron sits, Hagrid pitches a BUCKET between his knees. Harry and Hermione glance up questioningly.	Hagrid shrugs.

HAGRID:
Better out than in.	Who was he tryin' ter curse anyway?

HARRY:
Malfoy.	He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means...

HERMIONE:
(quietly) He called me a Mudblood.

HAGRID:
He didn'! Harry looks confused.	Hermione glances at him, then away, obviously pained by this.

HERMIONE:
It means dirty blood.	Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born.	Someone with non-magic parents.	Someone... like me.	It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.

HAGRID:
Yeh see, Harry.	There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.

HARRY:
That's horrible.

RON:
(BELCHES forth a slug) It's disgusting!

HAGRID:
An' it's codswallop ter boot. Dirty blood.	There's 'ardly a wizard today that's not half-blood or less.	If we 'adn't married Muggles we'd've died out long ago. Besides, they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can't do... (taking her shoulder) Don' you think on it, Hermione. Don' you think on it fer a minute.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail? Harry forces a smile.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. Harry nods, glancing gloomily at the towering stack of envelopes that remain.	Dipping his quill, he starts to write, when... a CHILLY VOICE fills the room.

VOICE:
Come... come to me... (CONTINUED)

HARRY:
What?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I was saying, six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records!

HARRY:
No... not you, that... voice.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Voice?

HARRY:
That... voice.	Didn't you hear it?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit drowsy.	Great Scott -- and no wonder -- look at the time!	We've been here nearly four hours! Dinner's nearly done!	If you hurry you might make pudding. Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun!

HARRY:
Spooky.

VOICE:
Blood... I smell blood... Harry stops cold, looking around for the source of the voice.

VOICE:
Let me rip you... let me kill you... Harry steps to the wall, playing his fingers along the stone, then begins walk, slowly at first, then more quickly, as if following something, moving faster and faster, rounding the corner and coming face to face with... Hermione and Ron.

HERMIONE:
Harry!

HARRY:
Did you hear it?

RON:
Hear what?

HARRY:
That... voice.

HERMIONE:
Voice?	What voice?

HARRY:
(eyes darting around) I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just --

VOICE:
Kill... Time to kill... As Harry stiffens, Hermione and Ron study him curiously.

HARRY:
It's moving.	I think it's going to... kill. Harry runs off.	Hermione and Ron exchange a glance, follow.

RON:
Harry, what are you doing? He points.	SHIMMERING on the wall are the words he saw reflected in water. THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED ENEMIES OF THE HEIR	BEWARE.

HERMIONE:
'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened	?'

RON:
What's  that?	Hanging underneath?

HARRY:
That's Filch's cat.	Mrs. Norris. The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket, eyes open and blank.	Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent WINDOW:	near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up a silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the glass.

HERMIONE:
Look at that.	Have you ever seen spiders act like that?	Ron...?

RON:
(backing away) I... don't... like... spiders. Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, seconds later, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING... when they stop, seeing the wall and, standing before it, Harry, Ron and Hermione.	A thudding SILENCE falls.	Then Draco pushes forward, eyes the wall, and grins nastily.

DRACO:
Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods! Draco's eyes find Hermione, just as Filch appears.

FILCH:
What's going on here?	Go on now! Make way... (stopping dead) Mrs. Norris! (rounding on Harry) You!	You've murdered my cat! I'll kill you!	I'll --

DUMBLEDORE:
Argus! Dumbledore marches forward, trailed by a phalanx of teachers.	Seeing the wall, Dumbledore's face darkens.

DUMBLEDORE:
Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. (to Harry, Ron, Hermione) Everyone except you three. As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall and, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou.	The full story's in my autobiography...

DUMBLEDORE:
She's not dead, Argus.	She's been Petrified.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Precisely!	So unlucky I wasn't there.	I know the very countercurse that could have spared her...

DUMBLEDORE:
But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.

FILCH:
(pointing at Harry) Ask him!	It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall! Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a Squib.

HARRY:
It's not true, sir!	I swear!	I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.

FILCH:
Rubbish!	He saw my Kwikspell letter!

SNAPE:
If I might, Headmaster... The others turn, watch Snape separate from the shadows.

SNAPE:
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time... Harry and the others blink.	Could Snape be defending them?

SNAPE:
However, the circumstances are suspicious.	I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.	You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail... As Snape's lip curls in disgust, Hermione leaps in.

HERMIONE:
That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor.	We'd just found him when Harry said...

SNAPE:
(raising an eyebrow) Yes, Miss Granger?

HARRY:
When I said I wasn't hungry.	We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris. Snape eyes Harry coldly, knowing he's lying.	Harry looks away... and finds Dumbledore studying him as well.

DUMBLEDORE:
Innocent until proven guilty.

FILCH:
My cat has been Petrified!	I want to see some punishment! (CONTINUED)

DUMBLEDORE:
We will be able to cure her, Argus.	As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes.	When they have matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.	In the meantime, I advise caution. To all. 60	OMITTED	60

RON:
A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own.	It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course.	It's also why he hates students so much.	He's bitter. Hermione, who's only been half-listening -- as if trying to unravel something in her mind -- speaks then.

HERMIONE:
Harry.	This voice.	You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?

HARRY:
He said he didn't.

RON:
Maybe he was lying.

HERMIONE:
I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald.	Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.

HARRY:
You do believe me, don't you?

HERMIONE:
'Course we do.	It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it?	You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified.

HARRY:
I can't explain it -- it was... scary. (frowning) D'you think I should've told them! -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.

RON:
Are you mad!

HERMIONE:
No, Harry.	Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.

HERMIONE:
Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets? A HUSH falls over the class. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger.

HERMIONE:
Yes, Professor.	But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets.	For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing. Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement. McGonagall considers Hermione's question for a long moment, then nods. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well.	You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: (MORE) (CONTINUED)

RON:
Three glasses who? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.	He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. (a beat) According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets.	Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school.	The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.

HERMIONE:
Muggle-borns. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Yes.	Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a chamber.	It has never been found.

HERMIONE:
Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin alone can control.	It is said to be home... to a monster. Ron's eyes shift.	Malfoy sits calmly, smiling to himself.

RON:
D'you think it's true?	D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

HERMIONE:
Yes.	Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried.	All the teachers are.

HARRY:
But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...

HERMIONE:
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

RON:
(in mock puzzlement) Let's think.	Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum.

HERMIONE:
(eyeing Malfoy ahead) If you're talking about him --

RON:
Of course!	You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!

HERMIONE:
I heard him.	But Malfoy?	The Heir of Slytherin?

HARRY:
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.	I mean, look at his family.	The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.

RON:
Crabbe and Goyle must know.	Maybe we could trick them into telling...

HERMIONE:
No.	Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules.	And it would be dangerous.	Very dangerous.

RON:
When do we start? 64	INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT	64 In a dark nook, Harry, Ron and Hermione huddle round a book entitled Moste Potente Potions.	The spotted pages are littered with DISTURBING ILLUSTRATIONS.

HERMIONE:
Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion.	Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another	'

RON:
You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

HERMIONE:
Yes.

RON:
Wicked!	Malfoy'll tell us anything!

HERMIONE:
Exactly.		But it's tricky.	I've never seen a more complicated potion.	Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed.	And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.

RON:
Hang on now.	I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.

HARRY:
How long will it take to make?

HERMIONE:
A month.

HARRY:
A month?	But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

HERMIONE:
You didn't have to tell me that. 65	EXT. QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY	65 We join the Quidditch match in mid-game.	The CROWD ROARS, watching as Slytherin Chasers, bent low over their new brooms, jet past the overmatched Gryffindors.

HAGRID:
Gallopin' Gorgons!	Slytherin's flyin' like they got dragon fire in their brooms... Ron fumes, looking as though he takes Slytherin's dominance personally.	Taking Hagrid's GIANT BINOCULARS, he trains them on the FACULTY BOX -- where Lucius Malfoy sits next to Snape. Harry circles high above the pitch, searching for the Golden Snitch.	Suddenly, Malfoy streaks by overhead.

DRACO:
All right there, Scarhead? Harry turns, eyes Malfoy malevolently. Behind him, a BLUDGER drops INTO FRAME, begins to streak toward his head. GEORGE HARRY!	WATCH OUT! Harry wheels and at the last possible moment, slips the WHISTLING Bludger.	CRACK!	George swoops down, BATS it away.	Harry turns, watches it soar away, then blinks: the Bludger turns, streaks right back at him.	Harry JETS OFF.

HAGRID:
(from the stands) Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a Rogue Bludger!

RON:
Rogue Bludger?

HAGRID:
Look fer yerself!	It's bin' tampered with! Harry executes a series of zigs, zags, loops and rolls, trying to shake the Bludger, but the Bludger is relentless. Ron instinctively draws his wand, begins to point it toward Harry and the Bludger, when... Hermione's hand intercedes.	She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.

HERMIONE:
You're joking, right?	Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky.	You could hit Harry. As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.

DRACO:
Training for the ballet, Potter? Harry glances at Malfoy's sneering face.	BUZZING inches above Malfoy's left ear is... the GOLDEN SNITCH.	Harry CHARGES.	Malfoy GULPS, swings clear, and watches Harry rocket past. As Harry chases the plummeting Snitch, Malfoy FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT.	They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing the HISSING SNITCH deep into the TRENCH circling the pitch.	Shoulder to shoulder, they RACE MADLY, driving and dodging the wooden support beams that crisscross their path. Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the BEAMS as it dogs Harry. Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the trench.	Harry BRUSHES the wall, battling for control. Malfoy turns, SNICKERS, then looks back... and finds himself heading smack into a wooden beam.	Panicked, he tries to pull up.	Too late.	Broom meets beam and Malfoy spirals out of the trench and -- THWUMP! -- flat on his back in the middle of the pitch.

HERMIONE:
Finite Incantatem! The Bludger hangs briefly in the air.	Slowly ceases spinning.	Drops heavily to the pitch.	Harry exhales, relieved, only to recall the searing pain in his arm.	As CONCERNED FACES swim above him, one particular face pushes through the others:

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Not to worry, Harry.	I'll fix that arm of yours straight away.

HARRY:
No... no... not you. (CONTINUED)

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying.	This won't hurt a bit... Lockhart TWIRLS his WAND, Harry braces himself, and... nothing.	He blinks, looks up:	the faces -- which now include Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid -- look horror- stricken.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Ah.	Yes.	Well, that can sometimes happen.	The point is, the bones are no longer broken.

HAGRID:
Brok'n?	He doesn't 'ave any bones at all! Harry looks:	his arm looks like an empty rubber glove. 66	INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY	66 A dazed Malfoy slumps out with Crabbe and Goyle.	Ron, standing by Harry's bed with Hermione, grins, then watches MADAM POMFREY pour out a STEAMING BEAKERFUL OF LIQUID from a bottle of SKELE-GRO.	A group of Gryffindors, including some of his teammates, stand nearby.

MADAM POMFREY:
He should have been brought straight to me!	I can mend bones in a heartbeat -- but growing them back --

HERMIONE:
You will be able to, won't you?

MADAM POMFREY:
I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful.	You're in for a rough night, Potter.	Regrowing bones is nasty business. Harry takes the steaming cup and drinks.	Grimaces.

MADAM POMFREY:
Well, what did you expect -- pumpkin juice? FLASH!	Harry blinks, sees Colin Creevey standing there.

COLIN:
That was brilliant today, Harry! Brilliant!

MADAM POMFREY:
Out!	All of you!	This boy's got thirty-three bones to regrow! 67	INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT	67 Harry fidgets in the darkness, half-asleep, then	his eyelids flutter slowly open...

BACK TO SCENE:
He SENSES something... a presence... when... Five BANDAGED FINGERS ENTER FRAME, begin to SPONGE his brow.	Harry bolts upright, finds...

HARRY:
Dobby!

DOBBY:
Harry Potter came back to school. Dobby warned him.	Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby. Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.

HARRY:
(pushing the sponge away) It was you!	You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through!

DOBBY:
Indeed yes, sir.	Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway.

HARRY:
You nearly got Ron and me expelled!

DOBBY:
At least you would be away from here.	Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see --

HARRY:
Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me? (CONTINUED)

DOBBY:
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. (waggling his fingers) Dobby had to iron his hands...

HARRY:
You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!

DOBBY:
(smiling weakly) Dobby is used to death threats, sir.	Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

HARRY:
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?

DOBBY:
Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He Who Must Not Be Named.	We house elves were treated like vermin, sir.	Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin... Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.

HARRY:
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

DOBBY:
This, sir?	'Tis a mark of the house elf's enslavement.	Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.	The family is careful not to pass Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever. Dobby's ears QUIVER, detecting... FOOTSTEPS.	He WHISPERS.

DOBBY:
Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts!	Harry Potter must not stay here now that history is to repeat itself!

HARRY:
Repeat itself?	You mean, this has happened before? Dobby seizes the Skele-Gro, BEATS himself about the head.

HARRY:
Tell me, Dobby? When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?

DOBBY:
Dobby cannot say, sir.	Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

HARRY:
No, Dobby!	Tell me!	Who is it? CRACK!	Dobby is gone.	SHADOWS flicker beyond the CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed.	Harry slumps down... peers through a slit in the curtains.	Dumbledore, in a nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL STATUE onto an empty bed.	Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey bustles in.

MADAM POMFREY:
What's  happened?

DUMBLEDORE:
There's been another attack. Madam Pomfrey GASPS.	It is not a statue lying there.	It is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker... Dumbledore opens the camera.	A JET OF STEAM HISSES forth. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What does this mean, Albus?

DUMBLEDORE:
It means our students are in great danger, Minerva.	Mr. Creevey was fortunate.	If not for this... (holding up the camera) He would surely be dead.

DUMBLEDORE:
Tell them the truth.	Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.	Tell them it's as we feared.	The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again. 68	OMITTED	68 68A	EXT. GIRLS BATHROOM	68A We PAN SLOWLY FROM the defiled wall to the bathroom door.

HERMIONE:
Again?	You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?

RON:
Of course!	Don't you see?	Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it.

HERMIONE:
Maybe.	We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

RON:
Enlighten me.	Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory?	Don't you think we'll get caught?

HERMIONE:
Never.	No one over comes in here.

RON:
Why?

HERMIONE:
Moaning Myrtle.

RON:
Who's Moaning Myrtle? There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A YOUNG GIRL COMES RACING OUT OF THE WALL.	FACE TO FACE with Ron.

MOANING MYRTLE:
I'm Moaning Myrtle.	I wouldn't expect you to know me.	Who would ever talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle? Myrtle SOBS LOUDLY, DIVES head first into the toilet.

HERMIONE:
She's a little sensitive.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Gather round!	Gather round!	Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?	Excellent.	In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club, to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions -- for full details, see my published works. The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to him. JUSTIN  FINCH-FLETCHLEY That Lockhart's something, isn't he?	Awfully brave chap. (offering his hand) Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.

HARRY:
Nice to meet you.	I'm  -- JUSTIN  FINCH-FLETCHLEY I know who you are.	We all do. Even us Muggle-borns. Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, where Professor Snape has joined Lockhart.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.	He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration.	Now I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.	You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him, never fear!

RON:
What's the fun in that? Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow.	They turn, walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords. (CONTINUED)

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position.	On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.

HARRY:
(eyeing Snape) I wouldn't bet on that.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
One-two-three --

SNAPE:
Expelliarmus! A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS Lockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.

HERMIONE:
Do you think he's all right? HARRY/RON Who cares?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
(rising unsteadily) Well, there you have it.	That was a Disarming Charm.	As you see, I've lost my wand.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
(as Hermione returns it) Ah, thank you, Miss Granger.	Yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do.	If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy...

SNAPE:
Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape.		Let's have a volunteer pair.	Potter, Weasley, how about you?

SNAPE:
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.	We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.	Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy, perhaps. Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they take their places onstage.	Grudgingly, they bow to each other.

DRACO:
Scared, Potter?

HARRY:
You wish. They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Wands at the ready!	When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent -- only to disarm.	We don't want any accidents.	One, two -- Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with a BLAST of WHITE LIGHT.	He jumps up, points his wand.

HARRY:
Rictusempra! A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach. He doubles up, WHEEZING.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I said disarm only!

DRACO:
Serpensortia! To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth.	Snape smiles with amusement.

SNAPE:
Don't move, Potter.	I'll get rid of it for you.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Allow me! Lockhart flicks his wand.	BANG!	The SNAKE flies into the air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towards Justin Finch-Fletchley.	As students SCREAM, Harry -- oddly calm -- approaches the snake.	It rises, fangs exposed, poised to strike Justin.

HARRY:
(in Parseltongue) Leave him! The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.

HARRY:
(in Parseltongue) LEAVE HIM! The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously -- slumps to the floor.	Harry blinks, as if coming out of a trance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his hand to Justin. JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY What are you playing at? Terrified, Justin backs away.	Confused, Harry eyes the faces around him.	Malfoy looks shocked.	Seamus and Neville's eyes glitter with fear.	Ginny bolts the room. Snape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF OF BLACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is both shrewd and calculating.

RON:
(taking Harry's arm) Come on.	Move.	Now. 71	INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - DAY (LATER)	71 Ron and Hermione usher Harry inside.	Harry glances up, sees Ginny Weasley staring down at him from the top of the stairs.	As their eyes meet, she turns for the girls' dormitory.

RON:
You're a Parselmouth!	Why didn't you tell us?

HARRY:
I'm a what?

HERMIONE:
You can talk to snakes.

HARRY:
I know.	I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.	But so what?	I bet loads of people here can do it.

HERMIONE:
No.	They can't.	It's not a very common gift, Harry.	This is bad.

HARRY:
What's bad?	If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin --

RON:
Oh, that's what you said to it.

HARRY:
You were there!	You heard me!

RON:
I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.

HARRY:
I spoke a different language?	But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?

HERMIONE:
I don't know, Harry.	But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.	It was... creepy. As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harry warily.	Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by without a word.

HERMIONE:
Harry, listen out me.	There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.	Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.	He could talk to snakes too.

RON:
Exactly.	And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.

HARRY:
But I'm not.	I... can't be.

HERMIONE:
He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know... you could be. 72	EXT. HOGWARTS' LANDSCAPE - DAY	72 A heavy snow falls.	Harry sits atop one of the towering hills facing Hogwarts.	Hedwig sits beside him.

HARRY:
Who am I, Hedwig?	What am I? 73	INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT	73 The trio study.	Harry, burdened by dark thoughts, looks up at Ron.

ERNIE:
So, anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory.	I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best he keep a low profile for a while.

HANNAH:
But why would he want to attack Justin?

ERNIE:
Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggle-born.

HANNAH:
And you definitely think Potter's the Heir of Slytherin?

ERNIE:
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard.	Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes?		They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue. (whispering darkly) Remember what was written on the wall:	Enemies of the Heir Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch.	Next thing we know, Filch's cat's attacked.	That first-year Creevey's been annoying Potter.	Then Creevey's attacked.

HANNAH:
He always seems so nice, though. And, after all, he is the one who made You Know Who disappear.

ERNIE:
That's probably why You Know Who wanted to kill him in the first place.	Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him. Harry doesn't need to hear anymore.	He slips quietly away.

HAGRID:
All	righ', Harry?

HARRY:
Hagrid... what're you doing here?

HAGRID:
(holding up the rooster) Second one killed this term. Reckon it's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear.	Need Dumbledore's permission ter put a charm round the hen-coop.	Yeh sure yeh're all righ', Harry?	Yeh look all hot an' bothered.

HARRY:
It's nothing.	I'd better get going.	I've got a lot of studying...

HARRY:
Professor, I swear I didn’t -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This is out of my hands, Potter. Mr. Filch, will you take care of this, please? Harry's eyes shift.	Filch lurks in the shadows beyond McGonagall.	He steps forward, HISSES QUIETLY.

FILCH:
Caught in the act.	I'll have you out this time, Potter.	Mark my words... As McGonagall leads Harry away, he looks back. Filch stares at Justin and Nick, then turns. CAMERA DOLLYS AWAY FROM HIM.

FILCH:
Dark magic.	That's what you've got, Potter.		Even the air you breathe comes out poison.	You're evil.	Evil as they come... 76	INT. GARGOYLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	76 McGonagall marches Harry down to an UGLY STONE GARGOYLE. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Sherbet lemon. The Gargoyle SPRINGS TO LIFE, its wings opening. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. McGonagall ushers Harry inside.	It's an elevator.	The Gargoyle's wings close.	Harry rises to an upper floor.

SORTING HAT:
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

HARRY:
Well, you see, I was wondering... (CONTINUED)

SORTING HAT:
If I put you in the right house? Yes... you were particularly difficult to place.	But I stand by what I said last year	you would have done well in Slytherin. Harry strips the hat off, tosses it back onto the shelf.

HARRY:
You're wrong! The hat sits motionless.	Silent.	Hearing a GAGGING SOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES) sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH.	It wobbles, then... BURSTS INTO FLAMES.	As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror- struck.

HARRY:
Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire.

DUMBLEDORE:
About time too.	He's been looking dreadful for days.	Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day.	He's really very handsome most of the time. (off Harry's look) Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Harry looks to the floor.	The ASHES swirl.	A baby Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the dust.

DUMBLEDORE:
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster -- BURSTS through the door.

HAGRID:
It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore!

DUMBLEDORE:
Hagrid --

HAGRID:
I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found.	It can't've bin 'im!

DUMBLEDORE:
HAGRID!	I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.

HAGRID:
Oh.	Right.	I'll wait outside then. As Hagrid exits, Harry looks hopefully at Dumbledore.

HARRY:
You don't think it was me, Professor?

DUMBLEDORE:
No, Harry.	But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me.	Anything at all? Dumbledore waits.	Harry debates.	Finally...

HARRY:
No, Professor.	Nothing. 78	EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY	78 Students drift into the snow with their trunks, heading home for holiday.	As Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear, Ernie and few others cast wary glances.

FRED:
Make way for the Heir of Slytherin!	Seriously evil wizard coming through! Ron grins, amused, then sees Harry -- anything but.

RON:
Oh, c'mon, Harry.	Fred's just having a laugh.

HARRY:
He's the only one.

RON:
Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night.	Who cares?

HARRY:
Maybe they're right.

HERMIONE:
(reproachfully) Harry!

HARRY:
(frustrated) I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue.	What else don't I know about myself?	Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.

HERMIONE:
You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't.	And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.

RON:
Why would that make anyone feel better?

HERMIONE:
Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin. 79	INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT	79 The Christmas Feast.	The Hall glimmers grandly as snowflakes tumble from the ceiling.	Harry and Ron sit with Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Everything's set.	We just need a bit of who you're changing into.

HARRY:
Crabbe and Goyle.

HERMIONE:
And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.

RON:
How? Hermione holds up a pair of SMALL CAKES.

HERMIONE:
I've got it all worked out.	I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.	Simple, but powerful. Ron glances at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who presently are eating everything in front of them.

HERMIONE:
You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are.	They won't leave the Christmas Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone. (MORE) (CONTINUED)

HERMIONE:
Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs.

RON:
And whose hair are you ripping out?

HERMIONE:
I've already got mine. She removes a SMALL VIAL.	Inside is a TINY HAIR.

HERMIONE:
Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes. (rising) All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion. Hermione points to the cakes in front of her.

HERMIONE:
Remember.	Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these. Hermione exits.	Ron looks at Harry.

RON:
Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong? 80	INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)	80 Harry and Ron, lurking behind a SUIT OF ARMOR, watch Crabbe and Goyle exit the Great Hall. Goyle spies the cakes instantly, perched on the end of one of the banisters.	Grabbing them, he reluctantly surrenders one to Crabbe and, in unison, they stuff them into their mouths.	They pause.	Look at each other.	And keel flat onto their backs. Harry and Ron dash out, drag Crabbe and Goyle across the floor and into a cupboard. 81	INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	81 Hermione, wearing a Slytherin robe, hovers over a smoking cauldron.	Harry and Ron enter.

HERMIONE:
Did you get it? Harry and Ron hold up their hands.	In each:	a TUFT OF HAIR.	Hermione points to a pair of SLYTHERIN ROBES.

HERMIONE:
I sneaked those out of the laundry. Harry and Ron nod, glance at the cauldron.	The potion resembles a thick, dark, bubbling mud. (CONTINUED)

HERMIONE:
I'm sure I've done everything right.	It looks like the book said it should.	Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.

RON:
Ugh.	Essence of Crabbe... They nod.	DRINK.	Ron swallows grimly, doubles over.

RON:
Think I'm gonna be sick... He runs into a stall.	Harry looks sick, steps to a CRACKED MIRROR.	Hermione pauses.	Looks worried. Something's wrong... INSIDE THE STALL:	Ron bends over the toilet, watches his reflection morph into Crabbe. IN THE CRACKED MIRROR:	Harry watches his face contort into the thick features of Goyle. Hermione looks at her arm.	Patches of fur begin to spread across her wrist and hand.	Terrified, she RUNS into a stall. Ron emerges from his stall, a dead ringer for Crabbe.

RON:
(adjusts voice) Bloody hell.

RON:
(lower still)

HARRY:
Less intelligent.

RON:
(dumbing it down) Bloody hell.

HERMIONE:
(from the stall) I -- I don't think I'm going.	You go on without me.

HARRY:
Hermione, are you okay?

HERMIONE:
Just go!	You're wasting time! 82	OMITTED	82

RON:
Don't swing your arms like that. Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. Harry goes a bit more "Neanderthal."

RON:
Yeah.	That's better.

RON:
What are you doing here? Percy squints, confused by Ron's voice.	Harry elbows Ron, who clears his throat and speaks in a lower voice.

RON:
What are you doing here?

PERCY:
I happen to be a prefect.	You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. It's not safe these days. Harry and Ron NOD, afraid to speak.	Percy squints again.

PERCY:
What're your names again?

DRACO:
Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Draco is walking towards them, glances witheringly at Percy.

DRACO:
And what are you doing down here, Weasley?

PERCY:
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.	You want to show a little bit more respect to a school Prefect!

DRACO:
Come he's hair	on, boys.	Weasley thinks going to catch Slytherin's single-handed. Percy steams. Ron.	Draco sneers, walks off with	Harry	and 85	OMITTED				85 86	INT. SLYTHERIN	COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)			86 Harry and Ron trail Draco inside, glance around warily.

DRACO:
Listen to this... Draco grabs The Daily Prophet, reads the front page.

DRACO:
'Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.	"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts.	"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately."' Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.

DRACO:
Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so much he should snap his wand in half and go join them.	You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. Embarrassment to the wizarding world.	All of them. Ron growls.	Harry elbows him.	Draco looks surprised.

DRACO:
What's up with you, Crabbe?

RON:
(low voice) Stomachache.

DRACO:
Well, go to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick in the arse for me!		You know, I'm surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet.	I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up.	He'll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon.	Father always said Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place.

HARRY:
You're wrong!

DRACO:
What?	Did you say that I was wrong?		You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Ron stiffens.	Worried.	Harry thinks, then:

HARRY:
Harry Potter.

DRACO:
(grinning) Good one, Goyle.	You're absolutely right.	Saint Potter. He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that Mudblood Granger. And people actually think he's the Heir of Slytherin. Harry and Ron exchange a glance.	Harry leans closer to Draco.

HARRY:
Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?

DRACO:
You know I haven't, Goyle.	How many times do I have to tell you? But my father did say this much: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened.	He wouldn't tell me who opened it -- only that they were expelled -- but I know this:	the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. (MORE)

DRACO:
So it's only a matter of time before one of them's killed this time.	As for me... I hope it's Granger. As Malfoy grins, Ron's fist rises... when Harry stops him.

DRACO:
What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd.

RON:
Ho! Harry turns, sees Ron staring wide-eyed:	Harry's SCAR is beginning to surface beneath the skin of Goyle's thick forehead.	And Crabbe's hair is... turning RED.	They both JUMP to their feet, DASHING out of the room.

DRACO:
Hey!	Where are you going? 87	INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	87 As Harry and Ron race toward the stairs, the BROOM CLOSET bursts open and a woozy Crabbe and Goyle stagger out. They freeze -- watch themselves run up the staircase. 88	INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	88 Harry and Ron sprint toward the desecrated wall, their bodies metamorphosing, until, finally, as they hit the door... 89	INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT	89 ... They are fully themselves once more.

RON:
That was close!

HARRY:
Hermione, come out.	We've got loads to tell you!

HERMIONE:
Go away!

MOANING MYRTLE:
Ooh, wait till you see.	It's awful! The stall's lock slides back.	The door opens slowly.

HERMIONE:
Do you remember me telling you the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations...? Even in shadow, they can see:	Hermione's face is covered in FUR, her eyes YELLOW, and POINTED EARS poke through her hair.

HERMIONE:
It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes!	Look at my face!

RON:
Look at your tail. 90	INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY (TWO WEEKS LATER)	90 Staggering under the weight of the LIBRARY BOOKS in their arms, Harry and Ron make their way to Hermione's bed, which is covered in	BOOKS.

HERMIONE:
Oh, good.	Put those anywhere. They look.	There is no anywhere.	So they just.	drop them.

RON:
Madam Pince asked that we relay a message to you, Hermione:	She'd appreciate it if you'd leave a few books for the rest of the school.

HERMIONE:
I've got to keep up, haven't I? Just then, Hermione's tail twitches INTO VIEW.

RON:
Is that thing ever going away?

HERMIONE:
Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey.	I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.

RON:
We all are, believe me.

HERMIONE:
Now.	What about the Chamber of Secrets?	Any new leads?

HARRY:
Nothing.

HERMIONE:
And has it gotten any better?	I mean... is anyone speaking to you?

HARRY:
Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday.	I suppose that's something. Ron takes a GET-WELL CARD from under Hermione's pillow.

RON:
'To Miss Granger.	Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.'	You sleep with this under your pillow?

HERMIONE:
Of course not.	I don't know how that got there.		Now go.	I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages. 91	OMITTED	91 92	EXT. SECOND-FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	92 Harry and Ron mount the stairs, emerge.

RON:
I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?

HARRY:
Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. As Harry sploshes off toward the bathroom, Ron steps lightly.

MOANING MYRTLE:
Come to throw something else at me?

HARRY:
Why would I throw something at you?

MOANING MYRTLE:
Don’t ask me.	Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me...

RON:
But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.	I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?

MOANING MYRTLE:
Oh sure!	Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach.	Fifty points if it goes through her head!

HARRY:
Who threw it at you anyway?

MOANING MYRTLE:
I don't know.	I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head. Harry sees a SMALL BLACK BOOK on the floor.	Picks it up.

RON:
Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.

MOANING MYRTLE:
I HEARD THAT! Harry and Ron dash out. 94	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	94 Harry examines the book as he and Ron walk.

HARRY:
This is a diary.	And it's old...

RON:
It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry. Harry starts to open it... when Ron grabs his hand.

RON:
Are you mad?	That could be cursed.	Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.

HARRY:
I'll take my chances... (opening it) Ahhh!	MY EYES!	MY EYES! Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the ruse.	At the end of corridor, Ginny stands, looking from the diary to Harry -- utter terror on her face -- then dashes off.

HARRY:
Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.

RON:
Who doesn't? Ron frowns suddenly.	On the first page on the diary, EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name:	TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.

RON:
Tin Marvolo Riddle?	Hang on.	I know that name... (thinking, then) Of course!	The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room.	I remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy.	I must have wiped slime off his name for an hour. Harry fans the pages.	They're empty.

HARRY:
That's odd.	He never wrote in it. 95	INT. HOSPITAL WING - LATER THAT NIGHT	95 CLOSEUP:	DIARY.	A GOLD EMBOSSED ADDRESS on the back reads:	WAXFLATTER'S  BOOKSELLERS.	422 VAUXHALL ROAD.

HERMIONE:
Tom Riddle... Hm.	And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago?

HARRY:
Special Services to the School or something --

HERMIONE:
Fifty years ago?	You're sure?

HARRY:
Yes.	Why?

HERMIONE:
Don't you remember what Malfoy told you?	The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --

HARRY:
Fifty years ago!	That means --

HERMIONE:
Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened.	What if he wrote about what he saw?	It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it.	If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?

HARRY:
That's a brilliant theory, Hermione.	With just one tiny little flaw.	There's nothing written in this diary.

HERMIONE:
It might be invisible ink. (pulls out her wand) Aparecium! She taps the diary three times.	Nothing happens.	The pages remain BLANK.	She frowns, passes the book back to Harry.

HERMIONE:
I don't know, Harry.	But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right.	It could be dangerous.

HARRY:
You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione?	I mean, you're not scared.	Of me.

HERMIONE:
I'm scared, Harry.	But not of you. 96	INT. GRYFFINDOR DORMITORY/COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)	96 CAMERA STARTS OVERHEAD, looking down on the boys' dormitory.		Seamus, Neville, Ron and Dean sleep.	One bed is empty.	CAMERA CRANES TO the Common Room, finds Harry sitting alone, flipping through the blank pages of the diary. Harry starts to set the diary aside, then notices a BOTTLE OF INK sitting on the desk.	An idea flickers. Taking his QUILL, Harry dips it, and hesitates.	As he does, a DROP of INK hangs, suspended like a tear, then... DROPS. The ink BLAZES briefly, then... VANISHES... as if it were sucked into the page.	Excited, Harry dips his quill again, and, this time, writes:	My name is Harry Potter. The words blaze, VANISH.	Slowly, oozing out of the page, comes a response:	Hello, Harry Potter.	My name is Tom Riddle. Harry's mind races.	Deciding, he MUTTERS the words he writes:

HARRY:
Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets? Yes.

HARRY:
Can... you... tell... me?

HARRY:
Excuse me.	Could you tell me where I am?		Hello	? The boy doesn't respond, eyes staked to the activity in the adjoining room... which Harry sees now is the Entrance Hall.	A group of ELDER WITCHES and WIZARDS -- Hogwarts Professors -- talk amongst themselves, then... abruptly go silent.	Make way for two YOUNG WIZARDS, bearing a STRETCHER.

TOM RIDDLE:
Professor Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE:
It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, Professor.	I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if... Riddle glances toward the young wizards, watches them carry the stretcher out of the Hall, into the night.

TOM RIDDLE:
... the rumors were true.

DUMBLEDORE:
I'm afraid they are, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE:
About the school as well? They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?

DUMBLEDORE:
Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid.

TOM RIDDLE:
Sir?	If it all stopped.	If the person responsible was caught...

DUMBLEDORE:
Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE:
(a long beat) No, sir.	Nothing. Dumbledore studies Riddle for a moment.

DUMBLEDORE:
Very well then.	Hurry along. Dumbledore strides directly past Harry, not seeing him. When he is gone, Riddle moves quickly, toward the dungeon steps. 98	OMITTED	98 &	& 99	99 100	INT. CORRIDOR - DUNGEONS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	100 Up ahead, a SPLINTER of LIGHT leaks through a DOOR. Riddle puts his eye to the crack.	Inside, someone is SPEAKING. (CONTINUED)

VOICE:
C'mon, Aragog.	Gotta get yeh outta here... C'mon now.. in the box... As Riddle pushes the door clear, Harry sees a second, smaller room.	Crouched by a BOX, is a huge boy... YOUNG HAGRID.	A STRANGE CLICKING comes from the BOX.

TOM RIDDLE:
Evening, Hagrid. Hagrid SLAMS the door shut.

TOM RIDDLE:
I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.	I don't think you meant it to kill anyone --

YOUNG HAGRID:
No, yeh can't!	Yeh don' understand!

TOM RIDDLE:
Hagrid.	The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow.	The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.

YOUNG HAGRID:
It wasn' him!	Aragog never'd kill no one!	Never!

RIDDLE:
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.	Now... stand aside... Riddle draws his wand, BLASTS the closed DOOR off its hinges, extinguishing the torches within.	Harry GASPS. A low-slung CREATURE with a tangle of black legs, a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers, scuttles out of the shadows.	As Riddle points his wand at it, Hagrid LEAPS...

HARRY:
Ron!	Ron!

RON:
What?	What's  happened...?

HARRY:
It was Hagrid.	Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.

HERMIONE:
It can't be Hagrid.	It just can't be.

RON:
We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

HARRY:
The monster had killed someone, Ron.	What would any of us done?

HERMIONE:
Look.	Hagrid's our friend.	Why don't we just go ask him about it? (CONTINUED)

RON:
That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid.	Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?

HAGRID:
Mad an' hairy?	Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh? The trio wheels, spots Hagrid grinning at them.	They instantly look guilty.

HARRY:
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

HAGRID:
Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent.	Fer the Mandrakes, yeh know. Accordin' ter Professor Sprout, they still got a bit o' growin' up ter do, but once their acne clears up, we'll be able to chop 'em up, stew 'em, an' get those people in the hospital un-Petrified.	'Til then, you three best watch yerselves, all righ'? They nod, watch Hagrid lope away.	Just then, Neville comes running up.	He looks pale with fright.

NEVILLE:
Harry, I don't know who did it, but... you'd better come.

HERMIONE:
It had to be a Gryffindor.	Nobody else knows our password.	Unless, it wasn't a student... (CONTINUED)

RON:
Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.

HARRY:
And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone. 105	EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY	105 Students stream into the Quidditch Stadium. 105A	INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - DAY	105A Harry, dressed in his Quidditch robes, dashes down the staircase with Ron and Hermione.	Down below, Ron spies Ginny.

RON:
Hey, Ginny!	Going to the match? Ginny looks up, startled, then shakes her head and exits.

RON:
I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day...

VOICE:
Kill this time... Let me rip... Tear. Harry freezes.	Ron and Hermione stop, knowing by his face...

RON:
No... don't tell me... Harry turns, as if following the SOUND, absently touching his fingers to the wall as he glances around.	Hermione studies him with great interest -- STUDIES HIS FINGERS -- then, abruptly, Harry turns away, shakes his head:	it's gone.	Hermione looks up, eyes vaguely upon Harry, but her mind miles away.

HERMIONE:
Harry... I think I've just understood something!	I've got to go to the library! As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS. HARRY What do you understand!

HARRY:
The library?

RON:
That's Hermione.	When in doubt, go to the library

WOOD:
Listen up now.	We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker, smarter.

GEORGE:
Not to mention they're dead terrified Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.

WOOD:
That, too. Just then, Professor McGonagall appears, barring their way.

WOOD:
Professor McGonagall -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This match has been cancelled.

WOOD:
Cancelled!	They can't cancel Quidditch -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Silence, Wood! You will return to Gryffindor Tower now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you need to see. 107	INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY	107 McGonagall pauses outside the door, turns to Harry and Ron.

NEVILLE:
Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe?	Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin?	The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin -- why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?

SEAMUS:
They can't close Hogwarts.	Where would we all go?

DEAN THOMAS:
I don't care what anyone says.	As long as Dumbledore's here, Hogwarts will be here. Harry WHISPERS to Ron.

HARRY:
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him.	But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets.	And that's a start.

RON:
But you heard McGonagall.	We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --

HARRY:
I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again. 109	INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (LATER)	109 CLOSEUP:	A drawer opens, a HAND reaches in, takes the INVISIBILITY CLOAK.	CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Ron and Harry.	All around them, the other boys sleep.	Harry pitches the cloak over himself and Ron.	They're gone.

HAGRID:
Who's there? Harry and Ron drop the cloak.	Hagrid lowers the crossbow. 114	INT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT	114 FANG, Hagrid's enormous BOARHOUND, THUMPS HIS TAIL at the sight of Harry and Ron.	Harry points to the crossbow.

HARRY:
What's that for?

HAGRID:
Nothin', nothin'.	I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter.	Sit down... I'll make tea... Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..

HARRY:
Are you okay?	Hagrid?	Did you hear about Hermione?

HAGRID:
Oh, yea.	I heard, all righ'.

HARRY:
Look... we have to ask you something.	Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets? Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer, when... there is a LOUD KNOCK.	The fruitcake SMASHES to the floor.	Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over themselves.	Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points it at the door.

DUMBLEDORE:
Good evening, Hagrid.

RON:
(whispering to Harry) That's Dad's boss!	Cornelius Fudge.	The Minister of Magic! Harry elbows Ron to shut him up.

FUDGE:
Bad business, Hagrid.	Very bad business.	Had to come.	Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.

HAGRID:
I never... You know I never, Professor  Dumbledore,  sir...

DUMBLEDORE:
I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.

FUDGE:
Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's against him. I've got to take him.

HAGRID:
Take me?	Where?	Not Azkaban prison.

FUDGE:
For a short stretch only.	Not a punishment, Hagrid.	More a precaution.	If someone else is caught, you'll be released with a full apology. Just then, there is a SHARP RAP on the door.	As Dumbledore opens it, Harry slumps.	It's Lucius Malfoy.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Already here, Fudge?	Good, good...

HAGRID:
What're you doin' here!	Get outta my house!

LUCIUS MALFOY:
My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- do you call this a house?	I simply called at the school and was told the Headmaster was here.

DUMBLEDORE:
And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside.	This is an Order of Suspension.	You'll find all twelve signatures on it.	I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch.	What with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts.	And we all know what an awful loss that would be. Malfoy hands Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT.

FUDGE:
Now, see here, Lucius.	Dumbledore suspended.	No, no... last thing we want right now... If Dumbledore can't stop these attacks... I mean to say, who can?

LUCIUS MALFOY:
That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted --

HAGRID:
An' how many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed!

LUCIUS MALFOY:
I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that.

HAGRID:
Yeh can take Dumbledore!	Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance!	There'll be killin's next!

DUMBLEDORE:
Calm yourself, Hagrid! (steely-eyed) If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside.	However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me.	You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it. Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Admirable sentiments.	We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um, killin's. Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid. Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath and says carefully...

HAGRID:
If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow the spiders.	That'd lead 'em right!	Tha's all I'm sayin'. Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him out.	As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL, scratching at the closed door.	Harry and Ron emerge from the cloak.

RON:
Hagrid's right.	With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.

HARRY:
Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass.	Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.

HARRY:
C'mon.

RON:
What are you doing?

HARRY:
You heard Hagrid.	Follow the spiders.

RON:
They're heading into the Dark Forest. Harry sighs, heads off.	Terrified, Ron grabs Fang, follows.

RON:
Why spiders.	Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'? 120	OMITTED	120 121	EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT	121 Fang crashes through low-slung branches and sharp brambles as Harry follows.	Ron gingerly picks his way, the JUMPS... as FANG HOWLS.		BRANCHES SNAP.	A RUMBLING NOISE sounds, then... SILENCE.	Harry spies something, points O.S.

HARRY:
There's something moving over there... something big. Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding them.	They start to flee... when Ron stops.

RON:
Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal.	Ron circles it in wonder.

HARRY:
It's been here all the time!	Look at it.	The Forest has turned it wild. Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.

HARRY:
C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.

RON:
I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --

HARRY:
Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT.	TWIGS SNAP.	A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry.	He peers up. SEES: An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG), the size of a small elephant. As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away.	Then:  its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS.	As if... listening.

ARAGOG:
You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like... men.

HARRY:
(breathing finally) Yes.	We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... (as it comes to him) ... Aragog, aren't you?

ARAGOG:
Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.

HARRY:
He's in trouble.	Up at school, there've been attacks.	They think it's Hagrid.	They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then... RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left. Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.

ARAGOG:
That's a lie!	Hagrid never opend the Chamber of Secrets!

HARRY:
But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.

ARAGOG:
The monster was born in the castle.	I came from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler. Ron turns.	TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward. Pause.	Waiting.	Watching.

ARAGOG:
We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.

HARRY:
But have you seen it?

ARAGOG:
I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me.	The girl was discovered in a bathroom.	When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. More SCRABBLING.	Ron looks up.	We PAN UP with him. SEE:	SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING DOWNWARD like paratroopers.	Ron GRABS Harry.

HARRY:
(annoyed) What! Ron points.	Harry looks.	Pales.	Turns slowly back to Aragog.

HARRY:
Well... thank you.	We'll just go...

ARAGOG:
Go?	I think not.	My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.	But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid. Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.

RON:
Can we panic now? CLICK!	CLICK!	CLICK!	Harry and Ron SPIN.	A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead.	Begin to move forward.	Harry and Ron SPIN again:	SPIDERS. Everywhere.	CLOSING IN. Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand.	The spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of the LIGHT chases itself away.	Around and around.	Then: The LANTERN goes out. Harry pitches it aside.	As one, he and Ron draw their wands.

RON:
Nice knowing you.

HARRY:
THE WINDOWS!	ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!

RON:
(trying) I CAN'T!	IT'S STUCK! Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window. Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE. Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows hold tight.	As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his SPIDER'S LEGS.

RON:
Thanks for that. (CONTINUED)

HARRY:
Don't mention it. They stop.	Both hear it:	a DISTANT CLICKING.	As the car flies over a ridge, they see them:		a SEA OF SPIDERS heading straight for them like a herd of raging wildebeest.	Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the wheel and sends the car sliding away.	The spiders STAMPEDE after.

HARRY:
That way!	It's the only way out! (looking back) Hurry!	They're catching up! Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA drops in front of the escape route.	Harry and Ron are as good as dead.

HARRY:
Can you get us in the air?

RON:
(jostling the gear stick) Flying gear's jammed! The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER.	The TARANTULA waits ahead.	Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear shift, pushing.		The tarantula's pincers open, ready to kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious spiders below.	The car barely avoids the rearing tarantula, then sails over the trees.

RON:
'Follow the spiders'!	Follow the spiders'!	If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid.	I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?	What have we found out?

HARRY:
We know one thing.	Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.	He was innocent.

MADAM POMFREY:
There's no point in talking to a petrified person.	She won't hear a word you're saying. Ron shifts uncomfortably.

RON:
We know that, Madam Pomfrey.	It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit.	She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it? A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.

MADAM POMFREY:
Very well then.	But be quick about it. As she exits, the boys step to her bed.	Absently, Ron picks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand. Eyes Lockhart's Get Well card.

RON:
You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? (off Harry's look) Right.	Forget I said it.

HARRY:
Wish you were here, Hermione.	We need you.	Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across Hermione's hand.	Harry watches the light dance over her fingers... then looks closer.	Sees the paper clutched there. 124	INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER)	124 Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.

HARRY:
'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk.	Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.	Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' (looking up) Ron!	This is it!	The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk.	That's why I can hear it speak.	 It's a snake.

RON:
But it kills by looking people in the eye.	Why is it no one's dead? Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite.	He mutters SOFTLY:

HARRY:
Because no one did look it in the eye.	Not directly at least... (in a rush) Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!	Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again... (MORE)

HARRY:
... And Hermione... had the mirror!	I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.

RON:
And Mrs. Norris?	I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.

HARRY:
The water... there was water on the floor that night.	She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... (scanning the page again) The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it!	That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed!	Spiders flee before it!	It all fits!

RON:
But how's the Basilisk been getting around?	A dirty great snake.	Someone would have seen...

HARRY:
Hermione answered that too. Harry points.	Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is: "Pipes."

RON:
(aghast) Pipes...?	It's using the plumbing.

HARRY:
Remember what Aragog said?	About that girl fifty years ago?	She died in a bathroom.	What if she never left.

RON:
Moaning Myrtle! Harry nods.	Just then, McGonagall's VOICE ECHOES throughout the castle, magically magnified. (CONTINUED)

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
(bursting in cheerily) So sorry.	Dozed off.	What have I missed?

SNAPE:
Just the man.	A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
My m-moment?

SNAPE:
Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
D-did I?	I don't recall... PROFESSOR McGONAGALL That settles it.	We'll leave it to you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.	Your skills, after all, are legend.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
V-very well.	I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL The rest of us should go and inform the students what has happened.

PROFESSOR SPROUT:
Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Ginny Weasley. Ron's knees give way.	As Harry catches him, the staff scatters, revealing what is written on the wall: Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. 126	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	126 Harry and a very upset Ron walk with desperate purpose.

RON:
She knew something, Harry.	She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets.	That's why she was taken.	I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood.	There can't be any other reason.

HARRY:
(pulling him away) C'mon.	Let's go see Lockhart.	He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.	We can tell him what we know...

RON:
Harry.	D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know -- Harry glances over, studies Ron's tortured eyes.

HARRY:
We'll find her, Ron.	Ginny's going to be fine.

HARRY:
Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead.	Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves.	Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.

HARRY:
Are you going somewhere?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Um, well, yes.	Urgent call. Unavoidable.	Got to go...

RON:
What about my sister?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Well, as to that -- most unfortunate.	No one regrets more than I --

RON:
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!	You can't go now!

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description -- (CONTINUED)

HARRY:
You're running away?	After all that stuff you did in your books?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Books can be misleading.

HARRY:
You wrote them!

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
My dear boy, do use your common sense.	My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves.	He'd look dreadful on the front cover.	No dress sense at all...

HARRY:
You're a fraud!	You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Harry, Harry, Harry.	There was work involved.	I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did.	No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos.	You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.

RON:
Is there anything you can do?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Yes, now that you mention it.	I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same. Lockhart lifts his wand, but Harry is quicker.

HARRY:
Expelliarmus! Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open trunks, his wand flying across the floor.

HARRY:
Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.

MOANING MYRTLE:
Who's there?	Oh... (smiles, flirty) Hello, Harry.	What do you want?

HARRY:
To ask you how you died.

MOANING MYRTLE:
(flattered) Oooooh, it was dreadful.	It happened right here.	In this very cubicle.	I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.	I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.

HARRY:
Who was it, Myrtle?

MOANING MYRTLE:
I don't know!	I was distraught! But they said something funny.	A kind of made-up language.	And I realized it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go away, and... I died.

HARRY:
Just like that?	How?

MOANING MYRTLE:
No idea.	I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there... Myrtle points to the bank of sinks.	Harry and Ron hurry over, examining the pipes below, the tile above, then... Harry sees it:	etched on one of the COPPER TAPS is a TINY SNAKE.

HARRY:
This is it, Ron.	This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

RON:
Say something, Harry.	Say something in Parseltongue. Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.

HARRY:
Open up. Ron shakes his head.	Harry's spoken in his regular voice.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Excellent, Harry.	Good work. Well then.	I'll just be going. There's no need for me...

HARRY:
Oh, yes there is.	You first. Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Now, boys.	What good will it do?

RON:
A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.

GILDEROY  LOCKHART:
It's really quite filthy down here.

HARRY:
All right.	Let's go.

MOANING MYRTLE:
Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.

HARRY:
Thanks, Myrtle. Harry turns.	Jumps.	Seconds later, Ron follows. 131	INT. PIPE - NIGHT	131 Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the damp floor of a stone tunnel. 132	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT	132 Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his robes.	Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his wand.

HARRY:
Remember.	Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Harry leads the way down the tunnel.	CRUNCH!	They look down:	a rat's skull.	All around them, the ground is littered with TINY SKELETONS.	Ron squints, sees something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead.	When he speaks, his voice is hollow with dread.

RON:
What's  that?	Up ahead?

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
That looks like a... snake. Terrified, Lockhart quickly HIDES HIS EYES.

HARRY:
Maybe it's asleep. Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting.	Harry shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY SKIN.

RON:
Bloody hell.	Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long.	Or more. THUD!	They turn.	Lockhart has passed out.

RON:
Heart of a lion, this one. Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and, quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to his feet.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
The adventure ends here, boys! But don't fret.	The world will know our story.	How I was too late to save the girl.	How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. I'll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin. Say goodbye to your memories. (raising Ron's wand) Obliviate! Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhart OFF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into the rock above.		As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harry the other.	Harry sits up, squints through the settling dust.	A SOLID WALL of BROKEN ROCK seals the tunnel between him and Ron.	INTERCUT Harry and Ron.

HARRY:
Ron?  Are you okay?

RON:
I'm okay.	This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. Lockhart sits up, dazed.	Ron picks up a rock and CONKS him on the head.	Lockhart PASSES OUT.	Ron calls to Harry.

RON:
I'll try and shift some of this rock.	So you can get back through.	And, Harry --

HARRY:
See you in a bit. Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off. He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.

HARRY:
(Parseltongue) Open. The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN.	Harry removes his wand and ENTERS. 133	INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT	133 A vast chamber stretches ahead.	Along the path are rows of STONE SERPENTS.	The serpents rest in pools of black water.	Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN. Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies motionless.	As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms, her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble.	A pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest. Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on the floor and kneels beside her.	(BOLD ITALICS INDICATE POSSIBLE FLASHBACKS.)

HARRY:
Ginny!	Please don't be dead. Ginny!	 Wake up!	Wake up!

TOM RIDDLE:
She won't wake. Harry spins. Tom Riddle stands nearby. He is strangely BLURRED around the edges, as though Harry was looking at him through a misted window.

HARRY:
Tom... Tom Riddle?	What d'you mean, she won't wake?	She's not...

TOM RIDDLE:
She's still alive.	But only just.

HARRY:
Are you a ghost?

TOM RIDDLE:
A memory.	Preserved in a diary for fifty years. Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his own hand on Ginny's arm.

HARRY:
She's cold as ice.	You've got to help me, Tom.	There's a basilisk --

TOM RIDDLE:
It won't come until it's called. Harry looks up, sees Riddle twirling a wand in his fingers.

HARRY:
Give me my wand, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE:
You won't be needing it.

HARRY:
Listen, we've got to go!	We've got to save her!

TOM RIDDLE:
I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger.

HARRY:
But she's dying!

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes.	I'm afraid so.	But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny.	She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes.	Ginny poured her soul out to me.		I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets.	I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her... Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins cruelly.

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

HARRY:
No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.

TOM RIDDLE:
It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat.	Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.

HARRY:
But... Why?...

TOM RIDDLE:
Because I told her to.	You'll find that I can be very persuasive.	Not that she knew what she was doing.	She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.	But then, who should find it... but you.	The very person I was most anxious to meet.

HARRY:
(getting angry) And why did you want to meet me?

HARRY:
Hagrid's my friend.	And you framed him, didn't you?

TOM RIDDLE:
It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.

HARRY:
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.

TOM RIDDLE:
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school.	So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

HARRY:
Well, you haven't finished it this time.	In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.

TOM RIDDLE:
Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore?	For many months now, my new target has been... you. (grinning) Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you.

HARRY:
Ginny stole the diary from my room?	But why?

TOM RIDDLE:
Come now, Harry.	Don't look so disappointed.	Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me.	And we couldn't be having this little talk.	And I have so many questions for you.

HARRY:
Like what?

TOM RIDDLE:
Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?	How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?

HARRY:
Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

TOM RIDDLE:
Voldemort is my past, present and future. Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to trace it through the air, writing three words:	"TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them: "I AM LORD VOLDEMORT."

HARRY:
You.	You're the heir of Slytherin.	You're Voldemort?

TOM RIDDLE:
Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name? (MORE)

HARRY:
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!

TOM RIDDLE:
Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.

HARRY:
He'll never be gone!	Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over the rock.	Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix.	The bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE in its golden talons.

TOM RIDDLE:
(giggling) This is what Dumbledore sends his defender!	A songbird and an old hat! Riddle tosses aside the hat.	He turns to the statue of Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE:
(Parseltongue) Speak to me, Slytherin. Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS.	There is a RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING. Harry turns away.	The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills out, uncoiling heavily to the floor.	Harry turns to the wall.	The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall. PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.

TOM RIDDLE:
Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter, shall we? Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE:
(Parseltongue) Kill him! The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward.	Harry turns, RUNS away.

TOM RIDDLE:
Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter.	The Basilisk only obeys me.

HARRY:
(to himself) Don't look.	Don't look into its eyes. Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent is FASTER.	Harry TRIPS.	FALLS.	The Basilisk RISES. Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike. Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk and circling its blunt head, confusing it.	The SNAKE SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife, driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering eyes. As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall, the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain.	Fawkes wings away, its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS: the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.

TOM RIDDLE:
Fool!	Think you're safe!	It can still hear you! As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE. Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE TUNNEL.

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, Potter.	The process is nearly complete.	In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead.	And I will cease to be a memory.	Lord Voldemort will return.	Very much... alive. Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of Harry.	Trapped, Harry glances around, then -- impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue of Salazar Slytherin.	The serpent strikes madly, but Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the top.	He turns.	Sees the Sorting Hat.	Sees what glitters within:	the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD. Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing serpent like St. George and the dragon.	In a mad rush of courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED.	Too tired to flee, Harry simply waits.	The serpent rises and, FANGS BARED... STRIKES. Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the SERPENT'S mouth.	It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as it drives a FANG into Harry's arm.	Harry clutches his arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor, watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes STILL. Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the blood soaking slowly into his robe.	As he yanks the fang free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now.	His eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.

TOM RIDDLE:
Remarkable, isn't it?	How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body?	If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now.	I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm turns a troubling gray. (CONTINUED)

TOM RIDDLE:
So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets.	Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged.	You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white now, a small ghost, the only evidence of life the TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER.	Harry studies the finger and what lies beneath it:	Tom Riddle's diary.	Harry begins to crawl toward her. (CONTINUED)

TOM RIDDLE:
Funny, isn't it?	The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the hands of a silly little girl. As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers, then... slips the diary free.

TOM RIDDLE:
What are you doing?	No.	Stop... Riddle's face creases in fear.	He LUNGES FORWARD.	But Harry is too quick.	Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES THE FANG into the book.	Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from the pages.

GINNY:
Harry.	It was me!	But I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. He wrote to me... took me over... I didn't even know whose diary it was.	I found it inside my cauldron.	The day we all went to Diagon Alley and... Harry.	You're hurt...

HARRY:
Ginny.	You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron... There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays his head onto Harry's arm.

HARRY:
You were brilliant, Fawkes.	I just... wasn't quick enough. Then Harry blinks, looks down.	Thick pearly TEARS are trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm.	Almost instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself. (CONTINUED)

HARRY:
Of course.	Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. (looking up at Ginny) It's all right, Ginny.	It's over. It's just a memory... 134	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER)	134 With Fawkes gliding gracefully ahead of them, Harry and Ginny make their way back. Up ahead, SHIFTING ROCK can be heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS. Ron's face appears.

RON:
You're alive.	I can't believe it.

GINNY:
I'm going to be expelled, I just know it!

RON:
(to Harry) Remind you of anyone?

HARRY:
Where's Lockhart? Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMING placidly.

RON:
His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is.	I keep having to stop him wandering off.	He's a danger to himself.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Hello.	Odd sort of place, this, isn't it?	Do you live here?

RON:
No. Ron turns, raises his eyebrows at Harry.	Harry looks upward.	There is an opening, hundreds of feet up.	Just then, Fawkes circles back, fluttering in front of Harry. (CONTINUED)

RON:
What's with the bird?

HARRY:
I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here.

GILDEROY LOCKHART:
Amazing!	This is just like magic!

DUMBLEDORE:
Ingenious.	Simply	ingenious. (looking up) Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.	I taught him myself fifty years ago.	After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped.	When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been.

GINNY:
I didn't know whose diary it was, sir. I swear. I found it inside my cauldron. (to the others) The day we all went to Diagon Alley.

GINNY:
But I understand if... given all the trouble I've caused... if you!--

DUMBLEDORE:
Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley.	No, I think you've endured enough.	I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however.	And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate.	I always find that cheers me up.	Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Certainly, Albus. As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go.	Mrs. Weasley's VOICE carries: MRS. WEASLEY A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny!	What were you thinking?	Haven't I always told you?	Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain! Harry and Ron turn back.	See Dumbledore regarding them gravely.

DUMBLEDORE:
You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?

DUMBLEDORE:
Therefore, it seems only fitting... (eyes twinkling) That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor the House Cup. (CONTINUED)

DUMBLEDORE:
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.	We need our gamekeeper back. Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.

DUMBLEDORE:
First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.	Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something.	Am I right?

HARRY:
It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things.	Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.

DUMBLEDORE:
You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.	Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.

HARRY:
Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?

DUMBLEDORE:
Not intentionally, but... yes.

HARRY:
So the Sorting Hat was right.	I should be a Slytherin.

DUMBLEDORE:
It's true, Harry.	You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes.		Resourcefulness. Determination.	A certain disregard for the rules.	Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.

HARRY:
Only because I asked it to.

DUMBLEDORE:
Exactly.	Which makes you very different from Voldemort.	It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry.	It's our choices. (smiling at him) If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this. Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry.	An ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.

HARRY:
'Godric Gryffindor.'

DUMBLEDORE:
Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat.

HARRY:
Dobby!	This is your Master?	The family you serve is the Malfoys! Dobby nods, chagrined.	Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Out of my way, Potter. (to Dumbledore) So!	You've returned!

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes.	When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. (a wry smile) Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh yes.	It was Voldemort.	Only this time, he chose to act through someone else.	By means of... this. As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy, Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to Lucius.

DUMBLEDORE:
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. (a chill to his voice) One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands.	The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe. (CONTINUED)

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Come, Dobby.	We're  leaving. As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICKS HIM through it, then exits himself.	Harry stares at the empty doorway as DOBBY'S PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from the corridor.

HARRY:
Sir?	I wonder if I could have that. Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary.

HARRY:
Mr. Malfoy!	I have something of yours. Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's hand.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Mine?	I don't know what you're talking about.

HARRY:
I think you do, sir.	I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Prove it! He turns away.	As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching the diary in his hand, Harry mouths the words:	Open it. Dobby looks down curiously.	Inside... is a SOCK.	He GASPS.

LUCIOUS MALFOY:
Dobby, come!	Dobby!

DOBBY:
(in wonderment) Master has given Dobby a sock. Master has presented Dobby with clothes.	Dobby is... free!

LUCIUS MALFOY:
What?	I didn't -- He wheels, sees Harry standing with one leg crossed:	His right ankle is bare.	Instantly, Malfoy charges forth.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
You've lost me my servant!

DOBBY:
You shall not harm Harry Potter! Dobby steps between and -- BANG!	Malfoy flies backwards, lands in a crumpled heap.	Rising, he stares murderously at Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too. With that, he turns, storms off.

DOBBY:
Harry Potter freed Dobby!	How can Dobby ever repay him?

HARRY:
Just promise me something.

DOBBY:
Anything, sir.

HARRY:
Never try to save my life again. Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone. 136	OMITTED	136 137	INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT	137 Fear and suspicion banished, the House tables abuzz with excitement and anticipation... all except the Slytherins, who do not share the general feeling.

HERMIONE:
You solved it!	You solved it!

HARRY:
With loads of help from you. She turns to embrace Ron.	They pause, an awkward moment between them and... shake hands instead.

RON:
Welcome back, Hermione. McGonagall taps her goblet.	Dumbledore stands.

DUMBLEDORE:
Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified. Everyone applauds.

DUMBLEDORE:
Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Oh, no! At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN.	It's Hagrid.	He enters.	Stops.	Looks around.	The room falls SILENT.	All eyes upon him.	He glances around. Nervous.		Embarrassed.

HAGRID:
Sorry I'm late.	The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n confused.	Some ruddy bird named Errol.

HAGRID:
I jus' want to say... that if it wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an' Ron... and Hermione... Well, I jus' want to say... Thanks.

HARRY:
There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly... brings his hands together.	The others join him.	Soon, everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING.	As the students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes, and... CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the celebration.	WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the night.

AUNT MARGE:
Wretched.	Ripper got sick.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Ah.	How... unfortunate.

AUNT MARGE:
I would've left him with the others, but he pines so when I'm away.	Don't you, darling?

HARRY:
Uncle Vernon.	I need you to sign this form.

HARRY:
I will if she does.

AUNT MARGE:
(turning, eyeing Harry) So.	Still here, are you?

HARRY:
Yes.

AUNT MARGE:
Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone.	Damn good of my brother to keep you, if you ask me. (to Vernon, Petunia) It'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

AUNT MARGE:
Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that my neffy poo? Come and say hello to your Auntie Marge.

UNCLE VERNON:
Can I tempt you, Marge?

AUNT MARGE:
Just a small one.	A bit more.	a bit more... That's the boy. (taking a sloppy sip) Aah.	Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up for me, what with twelve dogs.

AUNT MARGE:
What are you smirking at!	Where is it that you send him, Vernon?

UNCLE VERNON:
St. Brutus's.	It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.

AUNT MARGE:
I see.	And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?

HARRY:
(sarcastically) Oh, yes.	I've been beaten loads of times.

AUNT MARGE:
Excellent.	I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. (another sip) Still.	Mustn't blame yourself for how this one's turned out, Vernon. It all comes down to blood.	Bad blood will out.	What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?

AUNT PETUNIA:
(agitated) Nothing.	That is... he didn't work.	He was -- unemployed.

AUNT MARGE:
Of course.	And a drunk, I expect --

HARRY:
That's a lie. Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.

AUNT MARGE:
What did you say?

HARRY:
My dad wasn't a drunk. POP!	The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Oh my goodness!	Marge!

AUNT MARGE:
Not to worry, Petunia.	I have a very firm grip.

UNCLE VERNON:
You go to bed.	Now.

AUNT MARGE:
Quiet, Vernon.	It doesn't matter about the father.	In the end it comes down to the mother.	You see it all the time with dogs.		If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup...

I should tell you, Mr. Potter, earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located just south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.	The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified.	She has no recollection of the incident whatsoever.

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
So that's that, and no harm done. (smiling) Pea soup?

HARRY:
No thank you.	Minister... I don't understand.	I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
(dishing up a bowl) Oh, come now, Harry.	The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts!	On the other hand... running away like that... given the state of things... very, very irresponsible.

HARRY:
'The state of things' sir?

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
We have a killer on the loose.

HARRY:
Sirius Black, you mean.	But... what's that got to do with me?

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
Hm?	Oh, nothing.	You're safe, that's what matters.	Tomorrow you'll be on your way to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them brought here for you.

RON:
A cat!	Is that what they told you?	Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me.

Kill me? Mr. Weasley nods.	Nervously.

Hi, Harry.	Ron.	Hermione. (CONTINUED)

HERMIONE:
C'mon.	We're in here.

RON:
Who d'you reckon he is?

HERMIONE:
Professor R.J. Lupin.

RON:
You know everything.	How is it she knows everything?

HERMIONE:
It's on his case.

HARRY:
Is he really asleep?

HERMIONE:
Seems to be.	Why?	What is it, Harry?

HARRY:
Close the door.

RON:
Let me get this straight.	Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?

RON:
Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic...

HERMIONE:
Why're we stopping?	We can't be there yet...

RON:
What's going on? (CONTINUED)

HARRY:
Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?

HERMIONE:
Ouch!	Ron, that was my foot!

RON:
There's something moving out there.	I think... people are coming aboard.

RON:
Bloody hell.	What's happening?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Don't.	Move.

HERMIONE:
Harry?	Harry, are you all right?

HARRY:
Thanks.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Chocolate.	Eat.	It'll help.

HARRY:
What was that -- that thing?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
A Dementor.	One of the guards of Azkaban.	It's gone now.

HERMIONE:
It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I need to have a word with the driver.	Excuse me. (the chocolate) Eat.	It'll help.

HARRY:
What happened to me?

RON:
Well, you sort of went.	rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.

HARRY:
And did either of you?	You know... pass out?

RON:
No.	I felt... weird.	Like I'd never be cheerful again.	But... no. Harry turns to Hermione.	She shakes her head.

HERMIONE:
I was trembling.	Cold.	But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...

HARRY:
But someone was screaming.	A woman.

HERMIONE:
No one was screaming, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
Welcome!	Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!	I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast.	I myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair...

DUMBLEDORE:
Mm.	Yes.	First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts.	Good luck to you, Professor.

HERMIONE:
Of course!	That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.	Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!

DUMBLEDORE:
(turning grave) Finally, on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts -- at the request of the Ministry of Magic -- will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban.

DUMBLEDORE:
The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds.	While they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities.	Under no circumstances are you to approach them.	It is not in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving.

HARRY:
Fortuna Major. 38	INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT	38 The Gryffindors trail through the common room, the girls heading one way, boys the other. 39	INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (LATER)	39 While those around him sleep, Harry takes the PHOTOGRAPH of his parents, sets it next to his bed, then glances around in quiet contentment. (CONTINUED)

RON:
Good to be home, eh, Harry?

HARRY:
Yeah... As his breath CLOUDS THE GLASS, we gradually... FADE OUT.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Welcome, my children.	In this room, you shall explore the mysterious art of Divination.	In this room, you shall discover if you possess...

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
... the Sight.	Hello.	I am Professor Trelawney.	Together, we shall cast ourselves into the future.	But know this.		One either has the Gift or not.	It cannot be divined from the pages of a book.	Books only cloud one's Inner Eye.

HERMIONE:
(under her breath) What rubbish.

RON:
Where'd you come from?

HERMIONE:
Me?	I've been here all along.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
(spinning on Neville) You, boy!	Is your grandmother well?

NEVILLE:
I... I think so.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
I wouldn't be so sure of that. (continuing) The first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves.	If all goes well, we will proceed to palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. (eyeing Parvati) By the way, dear, beware a red- haired man.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu.	I myself will lose my voice.	And in late spring, one of our number will... leave us forever.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Well then.	Shall we? CUT TO:

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Broaden your minds, my dears.	And allow your eyes to see... beyond.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear. (then, casually) Mr. Longbottom, after you've broken your first cup...

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
... would you be so kind as to select one of the blue ones?	I'm rather partial to the pink. (pausing by Ron) What do you see in Mr. Potter's cup, Mr. Weasley?

RON:
Well.	He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering.	But this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness.	So... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
My dear boy... You have the Grim.

SEAMUS:
The Grin?	What's the Grin?

PARVATI:
Not the grin, you idiot.	The Grim.

DEAN THOMAS:
But what does it mean, Professor?

LAVENDER:
'The Grim...' All turn, see Lavender bent over her textbook.

LAVENDER:
'Taking the form of a giant spectral dog, it is among the darkest omens in our world.	It is an omen... of death.'

HERMIONE:
Death omens.		Honestly.	If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline.	Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.

RON:
Ancient Runes?	Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?

HERMIONE:
A fair few.

RON:
Hang on.	Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination.	You'd have to be in two classes at once.

HERMIONE:
Don't be silly.	How could anyone be in two classes at once? (mimicking Trelawney) Broaden your minds...

HAGRID:
C'mon now, get a move on!	Got a real treat for yeh.	Great lesson comin' up.	Follow me.

HAGRID:
Gather 'round.	Find yerself a spot. That's it.	Now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books --

DRACO:
And exactly how do we do that?

HAGRID:
Crikey.	Didn' yeh know?	All yeh've got ter do is stroke 'em.		Look --

HAGRID:
Righ' then.	So... so.	yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the Magical Creatures.	Right. So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em.

DRACO:
God, this place is going to the dogs.	Wait until my father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.

HARRY:
Listen, you stupid prat -- Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.

DRACO:
Potter, there's a Dementor behind you.

HAGRID:
Gee up, there! (grinning) Beau'iful, isn' he?

RON:
Hagrid.	Exactly what is that?

HAGRID:
A Hippogriff, o' course.	Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud.	Easily offended, Hippogriffs are.	Don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh do.	Right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello?

HAGRID:
Good man, Harry! Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.

HAGRID:
Tha's it.	Easy now... stop!	This here's Buckbeak, Harry.	Yeh want ter let 'im make the firs' move. It's polite, see?	Jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him.	Ready?

HAGRID:
Back off, Harry!	Back off!

HAGRID:
Well done, Harry!	Go on.	Give 'im a pat.

HAGRID:
Look at that!	I reckon he migh' let yeh ride 'im!

HARRY:
(smile drooping) Excuse me?

HAGRID:
We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint.	Mind yeh don' pull any feathers out.	He won' like that.

HAGRID:
Off yeh go!

HAGRID:
Good work, Harry! (under his breath) How'm I doin' me firs' day?

HARRY:
Brilliant... Professor.

DRACO:
Give me a go at that thing.	If Potter can do it, it must be easy.	You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute --

HAGRID:
Malfoy!	No!

DRACO:
It's killed me!	It's killed me!

HAGRID:
Calm yerself!	Yer fine... jus' a scratch...

HERMIONE:
Hagrid.	He's got to be taken to a hospital.	I'll go with you, if you like --

HAGRID:
No.	I'm the teacher.	You all... you all just... Class dismissed!

PANSY:
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

DRACO:
(a tad theatrical) It comes and goes.	Still.	I consider myself lucky.	According to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two... and I could've lost the arm.

RON:
The little git.	He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?

HARRY:
At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.

HERMIONE:
Yes.	But I hear Draco's father's furious.	I don't think we've heard the end of this...

SEAMUS:
He's been sighted!

RON:
Who?

HERMIONE:
Achintee?	That's not far from here...

NEVILLE:
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?

LAVENDER:
With the Dementors at every entrance?

LAVENDAR:
Dementors?	He's already slipped by them once, hasn't he?	Who's to say he can't do it again?

BEM:
That's right.		Black could be anywhere.	It's like trying to catch smoke.	Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.

OMITTED:
47 & 48

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Intriguing, yes?	Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's inside?

SEAMUS:
(in a hushed voice) That's a Boggart, that is.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can anyone tell us what a Boggart looks like?

HERMIONE:
No one knows.

RON:
When'd she get here?

HERMIONE:
Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears most. That's what makes it so --

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Terrifying, yes.	Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a Boggart. Let's practice it now, shall we? Without wands, please.	Riddikulus!

STUDENTS:
Riddikulus!

DRACO:
(muttering softly) It's this class that's ridiculous.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Good.	So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.	What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter.		You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.	Neville, come up here, will you?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
What would you say is the thing that frightens you most?

NEVILLE:
Profter... Snafpt...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry.

NEVILLE:
Professor Snape. Everyone LAUGHS good-naturedly.	Lupin nods thoughtfully.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Hmmm... yes.	Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?

NEVILLE:
Yes, but I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
It won't.	But I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very clearly in your mind.	Can you do that?

NEVILLE:
(closing his eyes) She carries a red handbag...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
That's fine.	We don't need to hear it.	If you see it, we will. Now, when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
You can do this, Neville. Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Right then.		Wand at the ready. One.	Two.	Three!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Think, Neville.	Think!

NEVILLE:
R-r-riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Ron!	Forward!

RON:
Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Parvati!

PARVATI:
Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Mr. Thomas! As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA.

DEAN THOMAS:
Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Next!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Here!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Well done, everyone.	I think that's enough excitement for today.

HARRY:
Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL But I don't say so.	A parent or guardian must sign, and since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. (a flicker of pity) I'm sorry, Potter.	But that's my final word.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
So.	No Hogsmeade, eh ? 51 thru 54	OMITTED	51 thru 54 55 EXT. BRIDGE (HOGWARTS GROUNDS) - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)	55 Deep in the distance, some BOYS skate about on brooms, tossing a RAGGED QUAFFLE back and forth.	CAMERA TILTS. FINDS Harry and Lupin walking along the bridge.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Well, don't feel too bad.	I was roundly disappointed the first time I went.

HARRY:
(nodding glumly) Not to mention The Shrieking Shack, which, according to Hermione, is the most severely haunted building in Britain.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Yes, that too...

HARRY:
Professor, can I ask you something?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart. (off Harry's surprise) I should think it'd be obvious. I assumed the Boggart would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
But clearly... I was wrong.

HARRY:
I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the Dementors...

HARRY:
Before I fainted... I heard something.	A woman.	Screaming.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives.	Our pain becomes their power.

HARRY:
I think it was my mother.	The night she was murdered.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
The first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.	Not by your scar.	By your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. (nodding) Yes.	I knew her.	She was there for me at a time when no one else was.	We used to talk for hours. She was not only a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman.	She had a way of seeing the beauty in whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in themselves...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Which perhaps explains her affection for your father.	James had, shall we say, a certain talent for trouble.	A gift, rumor has it, he passed on to you.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents, Harry -- but know this... (eyeing Harry intensely) They lived.	Every moment of every day.	You should know that. That's how they'd want to be remembered.

HERMIONE:
And the post office!	It's about 200 owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves, depending on how fast you want your letter to go!

RON:
And Honeyduke's is brilliant! Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees -- and blood-flavored lollipops for Halloween!

HERMIONE:
But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring.	Don't you think, Ron?

RON:
Huh?	Oh.		Yeah.	Dead depressing. Hang on.	I almost forgot.	I got you something wicked at Dervish and Banges.	It's a Pocket Sneakoscope.

RON:
If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin.	Mind you, Fred and George say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but I thought, you know, it can't hurt, given that...

HARRY:
Sirius Black's trying to kill me. Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.

HARRY:
I'm glad you had a good time. Really.	And thanks for this. (eyeing the Sneakoscope) Rubbish or not, you're right.	It can't hurt.

RON:
Oh, careful of those, they'll make your... On cue, SMOKE CURLS from Harry's ears and nose.

RON:
Never mind. 57	INT. MOVING STAIRCASE/SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT	57 (LATER)

RON:
What's the hold-up?	Only Neville ever forgets the password.

PERCY:
(pushing past) Let me through, please.	Excuse me, thank you, I'm Head Boy... (stopping dead) Back!	All of you!	No one is to enter this dormitory until it has been fully searched!

GINNY:
The Fat Lady... she's gone.

RON:
Probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor again.

GINNY:
No.	You don't understand -- Hermione GASPS.	GRABS Harry's arm.	He looks.	SEES: The Fat Lady's portrait has been SLASHED VICIOUSLY, great strips of canvas hanging from the frame.	Just then, Dumbledore appears.

DUMBLEDORE:
Mr. Filch.	Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.

FILCH:
There'll be no need for ghosts, Professor...

DUMBLEDORE:
Dear lady.	Who did this to you?

FAT LADY:
(in a trance) Eyes like the devil he's got.	And a soul as dark as his name.	It was him, Headmaster.	The one they talk about.	He's here.	Somewhere in the castle.	Sirius Black.

DUMBLEDORE:
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.	The rest of you... to the Great Hall.

SNAPE:
I've done the dungeons, Headmaster.	No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle.

DUMBLEDORE:
(nodding) I didn't really expect him to linger.

SNAPE:
Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected...

SNAPE:
You may recall, prior to the start of term, I did express my concerns when you appointed Professor --

DUMBLEDORE:
I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped Sirius Black enter it, Severus.

DUMBLEDORE:
No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe.	And I'm more than willing to let the students return to their Houses.		But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep...

DUMBLEDORE:
It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to rest.

SIR CADOGAN:
What villains are these that trespass upon my private lands! 63	INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - MORNING	63

SIR CADOGAN:
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan! Back, you scurvy braggarts! You rogues!

SEAMUS:
He's barking mad!

DEAN THOMAS:
What d'you expect?	After what happened to the Fat Lady, none of the other pictures would take the job.

NEVILLE:
But he keeps changing the password.		Twice just this morning!	I've taken to keeping a list.

SIR CADOGAN:
Farewell, comrades!	If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!

RON:
Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental.

SNAPE:
Turn to page 394.

HARRY:
Excuse me, sir, but... where's Professor Lupin?

SNAPE:
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?	Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.	Page 394.

RON:
(to Harry)

SNAPE:
Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?

SNAPE:
No one?	How.	disappointing.

HERMIONE:
Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.	A werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.

SNAPE:
Quiet, Malfoy!	Though one must admit to feeling your pain.		That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.	Tell me.	Are you incapable of restraining yourself?	Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?

RON:
(to Harry) He's got a point, you know.

SNAPE:
Five points from Gryffindor! (to the class) As a antidote to your ignorance, I prescribe two rolls of parchment on the werewolf by Monday morning, with particular emphasis placed on recognizing it. (suddenly) Passing notes, Potter?

SNAPE:
Not exactly Picasso, are you?	I hope you demonstrate more talent on the Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist. (MORE) (CONTINUED)

SNAPE:
If not, I fear you'll perish, given the weather forecast.	Until that time, however, you'll forgive me if I don't let you off homework.	Should you die, I assure you... you need not hand it in.

HARRY:
Come on!	Faster!

HERMIONE:
No!!! Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions.

FRED:
Peaky?	What d'you expect him to look like?	He fell fifty feet.

GEORGE:
Yeah, c'mon, Ron.	We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come out looking.

HARRY:
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.

HERMIONE:
Harry!	How're you feeling?

HARRY:
What happened?

RON:
You fell off your broom.

HARRY:
Really?	I meant the match.	Who won?

HERMIONE:
No one blames you, Harry.	The Dementors aren't meant to come on the grounds.	Dumbledore was furious.	After he saved you, he sent them straight off.

RON:
There's something else you should know, Harry.	Your Nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed in the Whomping Willow.	And well...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I'm sorry about your broom, Harry. There's no chance of fixing it?

HARRY:
Why do they affect me so, Professor?	I mean, more than everyone else...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with nothing but his worst experiences.	You're not weak, Harry.	The Dementors affect you most, because there are true horrors in your past.	Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.	You have nothing to be ashamed of.

HARRY:
I'm scared, Professor.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

HARRY:
I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that Dementor on the train go away...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
There was only one that night...

HARRY:
But you made it go away.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
(a beat) I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But yes, I can teach you. Perhaps after the holiday.	For now, though, I need to rest.	I'm feeling.	tired.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Beautiful...

FRED:
Clever, Harry.

GEORGE:
But not clever enough.

FRED:
Besides, we've got a better way.

HARRY:
What's this rubbish?

FRED:
Rubbish he says.	That there's the secret to our success.

GEORGE:
It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.

FRED:
But we've decided your need's greater than ours.	George, if you will...

GEORGE:
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

HARRY:
'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's Map'...?

GEORGE:
Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.	We owe them so much.

HARRY:
Hang on.	This is Hogwarts!	And that... No.	Is that really... Harry points to a small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore."

HARRY:
You mean, this map shows...

GEORGE:
What they're doing.

FRED:
Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year.		Now listen. There's seven secret passageways out of the castle.	But we'd recommend...

GEORGE:
The One-Eyed Witch on the third floor.

HARRY:
The One-Eyed...

FRED:
Witch, right.	But you best hurry. Filch is heading this way. (as they go) Oh.	And, Harry?	When you're done, make sure to give it a tap and say, 'Mischief managed.' Otherwise, anyone can read it.

HARRY:
Dissendium?

HARRY:
Mischief managed.

WOMAN:
A box of Jelly Slugs as well, Horace.	We're nearly cleared out. HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes.	Harry looks up to the cellar door, takes out the invisibility cloak... 77	INT. HONEYDUKE'S SWEETSHOP - SAME TIME - DAY	77 The CELLAR DOOR EASES open -- but no one appears.	We TRACK THROUGH a sweet tooth's dream, SWARMING with customers.	Up ahead, Neville prepares to lick the LOLLIPOP in his hand, when it simply floats from his fingers and out the door... 78	EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - CONTINUOUS	78 ACTION - DAY ... into the MISTY, FOG-SHROUDED chaos of Main Street. As the lollipop drifts on, FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow below... 79	EXT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DAY (LATER)	79 At this elevation, the MIST hangs in thick, undulating veils, the Shrieking Shack an eerie silhouette in the gloom.	Ron and Hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically, they're scared stiff.

HERMIONE:
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.	Did I mention that?

RON:
Huh?	Oh... All right...

RON:
Actually, it's fine from here.

HERMIONE:
Perfect.

DRACO:
Well, well.	Look who's here.	You two shopping for your dream home? Seems a bit grand for you, Weasel- Bee.	Don't your family all sleep in one room?

RON:
Shut your mouth, Malfoy.

DRACO:
(clucking his tongue) Now that's not very friendly. Boys, I think we're going to have to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his superiors.

HERMIONE:
(a harsh chuckle) Hope you don't mean yourself.

DRACO:
How dare you speak to me, you filthy, little mud --

DRACO:
Who did that!

DRACO:
Well, don't just stand there! (CONTINUED)

DRACO:
Wait a minute, there's something out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!

HERMIONE:
Harry...?	Harry?

RON:
Bloody hell, Harry!	That was not funny!

RON:
Those weasels!	Never told me about any Marauder's Map!

HERMIONE:
But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall, aren't you?

RON:
Oh sure.	Along with his invisibility cloak, his pack of exploding snap cards, his --

HERMIONE:
Oh, shut up.

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
Rosmerta, m'dear!

HERMIONE:
That's Madam Rosmerta.	Ron fancies her.

MADAM ROSMERTA:
It'd be a right sight better if the Ministry wasn't sending Dementors into my pub every other night.

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
We have a killer on the loose.

MADAM ROSMERTA:
Sirius Black?	In Hogsmeade!	And what would bring him here?

HERMIONE AND RON:
Harry?

MADAM ROSMERTA:
Come on then.	Let's hear it.

MADAM ROSMERTA:
You-Know-Who.	I've heard this rot.	It was all over The Daily Prophet back in the day.	And I'll say now what I said then:		Of all the boys I ran out of here, Black's the last who would've gone over to the dark side.	Hearsay. That's all the Ministry had. Hearsay.

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
Ha!	Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!

MADAM ROSMERTA:
Peter Pettigrew? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Little lump of a boy?	Always tagging after Black and...

MADAM ROSMERTA:
I remember him.	What's he got to do with it?

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
Black was vicious.	He didn't kill Pettigrew.	He destroyed him.	A finger.	That's all that was left. A finger -- there's your hearsay.

MADAM ROSMERTA:
Harry. (CONTINUED)

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
But that's not the worst of it.

MADAM ROSMERTA:
What could be worse? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This:	Sirius Black was and remains today... Harry Potter's godfather.

... and FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow.	HARRY'S POV ENDS. CAMERA TILTS UP, FOLLOWS Hermione and Ron until they LEAVE FRAME, then HOLDS ON a POSTER of BLACK, fluttering against a lamppost:	"Have you seen this wizard?" 84	EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)	84

HARRY:
He was their friend. And he betrayed them. He was their friend. (eyes hardening) I hope he finds me.	But when he does, I'm going to be ready.	When he does, I'm going to kill him.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic.	Well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.

HARRY:
If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Very well.	The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.	Ever hear of it?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
A Patronus is a kind of positive force.	For the wizard who can conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield.	The Dementor feeds on it instead of him.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory.	And not just any.	This memory needs to be a very happy one.	And powerful.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Got something?	Good.	Let it fill you up.	Lose yourself in it. Then speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum.	Without your wand...

HARRY:
Expecto Patronum... (CONTINUED)

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Right then.	Shall we? Harry nods, raises his wand.	Lupin, watching closely, reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate... As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES.	In the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly horrific.

HARRY:
Expecto... Patronum...

HARRY:
Expecto... Expecto...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Here! CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Quickly.

HARRY:
That's one nasty Dementor.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Boggart, Harry.	The real thing would be much, much worse.	Just out of interest, what were you thinking of?	What memory did you choose?

HARRY:
The first time I rode a broom.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly.

HARRY:
There's another.	It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is.	It's the happiest I've ever felt.	But it's.	complicated.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Is it strong? Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes.	Emotional.	Nods.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Then let's try it.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Think, Harry, think --

HARRY:
Just do it!

HARRY:
Expecto Patronum!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Well done.

HARRY:
I think I've had enough.	For today.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
So you know, Harry: You'd have given your father a run for his money. And, believe me, that's saying something.

HARRY:
I was thinking of him.	And Mum. Seeing their faces.	They're just talking to me.	Just... talking. That was the memory I chose.	I don't even know if it's real...

HARRY:
But it's the best I have.

RON:
Aaaahhhh!

HARRY:
Everybody out!

HARRY:
Show yourself.

HARRY:
Ron!	Ron!

RON:
Is he gone?

RON:
I don't know how he got in!	I was a bit busy dodging his knife!

RON:
And this bloody cat ate my rat!

HERMIONE:
That's a lie!

RON:
It is not and you bloody well know it! PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Silence!

DUMBLEDORE:
Sir Cadogan.	Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor Tower tonight?

SIR CADOGAN:
Certainly, good lady!	He had the password.		Had the whole week's, in fact.	On a little piece of paper.

NEVILLE:
I'm afraid so, ma'am. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (to the group at large) While we know Sirius Black is gone tonight, I think you can safely assume he will, at some future time, attempt to return.		Let me be clear.	You are not to move about the castle alone.	And you are not to write down the password!	Understood!

HARRY:
I could've killed him. Hermione turns, sees Harry staring out the window.

HARRY:
He was right there.	Close enough to touch. I could've killed him.

RON:
I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.

HERMIONE:
Harry.	Will you explain to your friend Ronald that he has absolutely no proof whatsoever that my sweet, unassuming cat ate his shabby, decidedly decrepit rat.

RON:
Harry was there!	He'll tell you how it was.	Go on, Harry, tell her.

HARRY:
No, I won't.	Know why?	Because I don't care about your stupid rat! I don't care about your stupid cat!	I've got few other things on my mind right now!

RON:
Really?	Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons!	A person could die being your friend, Harry!

HERMIONE:
How'd it go, Hagrid?

HAGRID:
Buckbeak liked London.

HERMIONE:
I meant the hearing.

HAGRID:
Oh.	That.	Well, I got up an' said my bit -- You know, how Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an' as long as yeh treated 'im with respect, he'd treat you the same. Then Lucius Malfoy got up an' said his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak was a deadly dangerous beast that no teacher in their righ' mind would expose their students to...

HERMIONE:
(dreading it) And...? Hagrid slings another rock into water.

HERMIONE:
You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid.

RON:
Draco.	It's him the Committee should punish.	It's him they should send off to the forest, not Buckbeak.

HAGRID:
Buckbeak's not going back to the forest...

HERMIONE:
(dreading the answer) Where's he going, Hagrid?

HAGRID:
He asked fer the worse, yeh see, Lucius Malfoy did.	An' the Committee granted it.	Buckbeak's bin sentenced ter death.

HARRY:
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

VOICE:
Watch it there, boy!

HARRY:
Mischief managed!

SNAPE:
Potter.	What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?

HARRY:
I was... I was... sleepwalking... A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips. (CONTINUED)

SNAPE:
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.	He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle --

HARRY:
My dad didn’t strut.	Nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate you lowering your wand.

SNAPE:
Turn out your pockets. Harry doesn't move, eyes still boring into Snape.

SNAPE:
Turn out your pockets!

SNAPE:
And this.	What might it be?

HARRY:
Spare bit of parchment...

SNAPE:
Really... (poising his wand) Reveal your secret!

SNAPE:
Go on.

HARRY:
'... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.'

SNAPE:
(smile drooping) Why you insolent little --

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Professor...? Snape turns.	Sees Lupin standing in the shadows.

SNAPE:
Well, well.	Lupin.	Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Harry?	You all right?

SNAPE:
That remains to be seen.	I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin.	This is supposed to be your area of expertise.

SNAPE:
Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I seriously doubt that, Severus. It looks to me as if it merely insults anyone who tries to read it.	I suspect it's a Zonko product.	Nevertheless, I shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess.	As you say, it's my area of expertise.	Come, Harry.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I don't know how this map came to be in your possession, Harry, but I'm astounded that you didn't turn it in.	Did you ever stop to think that this -- in the hands of Sirius Black -- is a map to you?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Your father didn't set much store by rules either.	But he and your mother did give their lives to save yours.	Gambling their sacrifice by walking about the castle unprotected, with a killer on the loose, strikes me as a poor way to repay them.	I won't cover up for you again, Harry.

HARRY:
Professor.	Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.	Someone I know to be dead.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
(only half-listening) And who was that, Harry?

HARRY:
Peter Pettigrew.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Very well.	I'd like you to return to your dormitory now.	Oh, and Harry?	Don't take any detours.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
If you do.	I'll know.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Relax... Let your mind... go... 102	INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING	102

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Crystal-gazing requires that you clear the Inner Eye. Only then, will you... See. Oh my, what do we have here. ?

HERMIONE:
Here we go again.	It's the Grim! It's the Grim!

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
(eyes narrowing) My dear, from the moment you first arrived in my class, I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.	You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.

LAVENDER:
'In late spring, one of our number will leave us forever!' You knew, Professor! You saw.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
On these occasions, I take no joy in my gift, Miss Brown.

RON:
She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see...

HARRY:
Professor Trelawney --

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
He will return tonight.... Harry stiffens.	Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW. HARRY S-sorry?

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
Tonight, when the clock strikes twelve, the servant shall break free.	He and his Master shall be reunited.	It cannot be prevented.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY:
So sorry, dear boy.	Did you say something?

HARRY:
No.	Nothing.

HERMIONE:
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak!	It's too horrible.

HARRY:
It just got worse. She and Ron look and SEE:

DRACO:
Did you see the big, fat blubbering oaf?!	Oh, this is going to be rich.		Did I tell you, Father said I can keep the head -- (looking up) Ah.	Come to see the show?

HERMIONE:
You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach... Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when...

RON:
Hermione!	No! She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her.	He looks away.

RON:
He's not worth it.

HERMIONE:
That felt good.

HAGRID:
Look at 'em.	Loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows...

HARRY:
I say we set him free.

HAGRID:
(shaking his head) They'd know I did it.	And tha' would only get Dumbledore in trouble.	Gonna come down, yeh know.	Says he wants ter be with me when it... when it happens. Great man, Dumbledore.

HERMIONE:
We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.

HAGRID:
Yeh will not!	Think I wan' yeh seein' a thing like this!	No. Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off. But before yeh do -- I wan' ter see you an' Ron shake hands, Harry.

HAGRID:
Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin betw'n you two?	Go on now...

HAGRID:
Good.	Now then.	Ron, I wan' ter see you give Hermione a hug.

HAGRID:
Go on!		You two've been at it all year.	An' I'm sick o' it.

HAGRID:
Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most pathetic hug I e'er seen.	But yeh did it, an' tha's wha' matters. There's jus' one other thing...

RON:
I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking...

RON:
Scabbers!	You're alive! (CONTINUED)

HAGRID:
Yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, Ron.

HERMIONE:
I think you owe someone an apology.

RON:
Right.	Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.

HERMIONE:
I meant me.

HAGRID:
Crikey.	Here we go agin... SMASH!	A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS.	As Hermione scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE bounces off the back of Harry's head.

HARRY:
Ow! Harry turns, looks out the window.

HARRY:
Hagrid...

HAGRID:
Yeh got to go!	It's almost dark. Anyone sees yeh outside the castle it'll be trouble!	Big trouble! 'Specially you, Harry --

HARRY:
C'mon.

RON:
He bit me... His eyes shift.	See Scabbers streaking away.

HERMIONE:
Ron!	No! As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give chase. 110A	EXT. RIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK	110A Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top. Hermione and Harry follow.

HERMIONE:
Harry.	You do realize what tree this is...

RON:
Now behave yourself.

HARRY:
That's not good. (yelling) Ron!	Run! Ron spins.	Looks toward Harry.

RON:
Harry!	Run!

RON:
Aaaahhh!

HERMIONE:
I've got you --

RON:
Harry!

HARRY:
Hold on, Ron!

HARRY:
No, Ron...

HARRY:
Nooooo!!! But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and... (CONTINUED)

HERMIONE:
Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!

HERMIONE:
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

HARRY:
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

HERMIONE:
Thanks.

HARRY:
Don't mention it.	Lumos. As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking tunnel.

HERMIONE:
Where do you suppose this goes?

HARRY:
I have a hunch.	I just hope I'm wrong...

HERMIONE:
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?

HERMIONE:
Ron!	You're okay --

HARRY:
The dog -- where's the --

RON:
It's a trap, Harry.	He's the dog. He's an Animagus...

HERMIONE:
If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!

SIRIUS BLACK:
No.	Only one will die tonight.

HARRY:
Then it'll be you!

HERMIONE:
Harry!	No!

SIRIUS BLACK:
Going to kill me, Harry?

HARRY:
Yes. (CONTINUED)

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Looking a bit ragged, aren't we, Sirius?	Finally the skin reflects the madness within.

SIRIUS BLACK:
You'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?

HERMIONE:
No!	I trusted you!	I covered up for you.	And all this time you've been his friend! (pointing) He's a werewolf!	That's why he's been missing classes!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
How long have you known?

HERMIONE:
Since Professor Snape set the essay.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
You're the brightest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.

SIRIUS BLACK:
Yes, you glow like the sun.	And you howl at the moon.	Enough talk!	He dies.	Now.	If you won't do it with me, Remus, I'll do it alone.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Wait, Sirius -- (CONTINUED)

SIRIUS BLACK:
I did my waiting!		Twelve years of it!	In Azkaban!	Trust me, you wouldn't have lasted a week!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
All right then.	As you wish...

HARRY:
No!

HARRY:
You betrayed my parents!	You sold them to Voldemort!

SIRIUS BLACK:
It's a lie!	I never would've betrayed James and Lily!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Harry!	You've got to listen --

HARRY:
Did he listen!	When my mother was dying!	Did he hear her screaming!

SIRIUS BLACK:
No!	I wasn't there!	And I'll regret it the rest of my life!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Someone else betrayed your parents, Harry.	Someone in this room right now.	Someone who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead.

SIRIUS BLACK:
He's as good as dead.

HARRY:
What're you talking about? There's nobody here.

SIRIUS BLACK:
Oh yes there is... Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel sing song:

SIRIUS BLACK:
Come out, come out, Peter Come out, come out and play... Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.

RON:
You're mad...

SNAPE:
Expelliarmus!

SNAPE:
(eying Black) Ah, vengeance is sweet.	How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Severus --

SNAPE:
I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And here's the proof.

SIRIUS BLACK:
Brilliant!	And -- as usual -- dead wrong.		Now give us our wands back.	Remus and I have a bit of unfinished business to tend to.

SNAPE:
Give me a reason.	I beg you.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Don't be a fool, Severus!

SIRIUS BLACK:
He can't help it.	It's habit by now.

SIRIUS BLACK:
Piss off.

SNAPE:
Witty as ever I see.	Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to the Dementors? (as Black reacts) Do I detect a flicker of fear? One can only imagine what it must be like to endure the Dementor's Kiss.	It's said to be unbearable to witness.	But I'll do my best.

SNAPE:
After you.

HARRY:
Expelliarmus!

HERMIONE:
Harry.	You attacked a teacher. Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.

HARRY:
You said Peter before.	Peter who?

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Pettigrew.	He was at school with us.	We thought he was a friend.

HARRY:
No.	Pettigrew's dead.	He killed him.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I thought so, too.	Until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map.

HARRY:
The Map was lying then --

SIRIUS BLACK:
The Map never lies.	Pettigrew's alive.	And he's right there.

RON:
M-me?	It's lunatic...

SIRIUS BLACK:
Not you, you idiot.	Your rat.

RON:
Scabbers?	Scabbers has been in my family for --

SIRIUS BLACK:
(bitterly) Twelve years.	A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's missing a toe, isn't he?

SIRIUS BLACK:
Finger.	Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead.	Then he transformed into a rat.

HARRY:
Show me. Lupin and Black turn to Ron.	He holds Scabbers protectively.

RON:
What are you going to do to him? Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.

SIRIUS BLACK:
Together.

PETTIGREW:
S-Sirius... R-Remus.	My old friends.

PETTIGREW:
Harry!	Look at you!	Y-you look just like your father.	Like James.	We were the best of friends, he and I --

SIRIUS BLACK:
Shut up!

PETTIGREW:
I didn't mean to!	The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses!	Ask yourself what you would have done, Sirius.	What would you have done!

SIRIUS BLACK:
Died!	Died rather than betray my friends!	And you should have realized, Peter, if Voldemort didn't kill you...

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
We would.

PETTIGREW:
No... please... you can't... (eyes darting, finding) Ron!	Haven't I been a good friend?	A good pet?	You won't let them kill me, will you?	I was your rat...

PETTIGREW:
Sweet girl.	Clever girl.	Surely you won't let them...

HARRY:
No. Pettigrew's lids lift.	Lupin and Black turn.	Staggered.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Harry, this man...

HARRY:
I know what he is.	But we'll take him to the castle.

PETTIGREW:
Bless you, boy!	Bless you --

HARRY:
Get off!	I said we'd take you to the castle.	After that, the Dementors can have you.

PETTIGREW:
Turn me into a maggot.	A dung beetle.	A Flobberworm!		Anything but the Dementors... (as Ron emerges) Ron!	Haven't I been a good friend?	A good pet?	You won't let them kill me, will you?	I was your rat...

HERMIONE:
Don't worry.	He's under the Somnambulist Charm.	It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged.

PETTIGREW:
Sweet girl.	Clever girl.	Surely you won't let them...

SIRIUS BLACK:
Beautiful, isn't it?	I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.	It'll be nice to do it again.	Freely. (turning to Harry) That was a noble thing you did back there.	He doesn't deserve it.

HARRY:
I don't reckon my father'd want his best friends to become killers for a worthless piece of vermin like Pettigrew.	Besides:		Dead, the truth dies with him.	Alive... you're free.

SIRIUS BLACK:
I don't know if you know, Harry, but when you were born, James and Lily made me your guardian...

HARRY:
I know.

SIRIUS BLACK:
And, well, I'll understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle, but, so you know, you could --

HARRY:
Come live with you?	When!

SIRIUS BLACK:
Soon as my name's cleared...

HERMIONE:
Harry...

SIRIUS BLACK:
Remus, old friend... did you take your potion tonight?

SIRIUS BLACK:
Run.	All of you.	Now.

SIRIUS BLACK:
You know the man you truly are, Remus.	This flesh is only flesh. (MORE)

SIRIUS BLACK:
This heart is where you truly live.	This heart!	Here!

HARRY:
No! (flashing his wand) Expelliarmus!

HERMIONE:
Professor...?

SNAPE:
Out of the way!

HARRY:
Sirius!

HERMIONE:
Harry!

HARRY:
NO!!!

HARRY:
Please, Professor.	Stop... It's me.

HARRY:
Sirius!

HARRY:
Sirius! (CONTINUED)

HARRY:
No... No! (drawing his wand) Expecto... Patronum!

HARRY:
Expecto... Patronum...

HERMIONE:
Listen, Harry.	They've captured Sirius.	Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss.

HARRY:
The Kiss...?

HERMIONE:
It's what Dementors do to those they want to destroy.	They clamp their jaws over the victim's mouth and... suck out his soul.

HARRY:
You mean, they're going to kill Sirius?

HERMIONE:
No.	It's worse.	Much worse.	You go on living.	But you have no memory.	No sense of self.	You're just a shall.	An empty shell...

HERMIONE:
Headmaster!	You've got to stop them!	They've got the wrong man!

HARRY:
It's true, sir.	Sirius is innocent --

RON:
It's Scabbers who did it!

DUMBLEDORE:
Scabbers...?

RON:
My rat, sir.	Only he's not really a rat.	Well, he was a rat.	You see, he used to be my brother Percy's --

HERMIONE:
The point is... we know the truth. Please, sir, you must believe us.

DUMBLEDORE:
I do, Miss Granger.	But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others.	A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah... a shooting star.	If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the time.	But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem...

DUMBLEDORE:
Mysterious thing, time.	Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous.	Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. (to Hermione) You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen.	And you would, I feel, do well to return before this last chime.	If not... well, the consequences are really too ghastly to discuss.	Three turns should do it, I think.	If you succeed, more than one innocent life may be spared tonight.

DUMBLEDORE:
By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.

RON:
What in bloody hell was all that about?

HERMIONE:
Sorry, Ron.	But seeing as you can't walk...

HARRY:
What just happened?	Where's Ron?

HERMIONE:
Seven-thirty.	Where were we at seven-thirty?

HARRY:
Huh?	Dunno... going to Hagrid's?

HERMIONE:
Come on!	We can't be seen! Hermione grabs Harry's arm, slams through the door.

HARRY:
Hermione!	Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?!

HARRY:
But that... that's... us.	This is not.	normal.

HERMIONE:
This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term.	This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.

HARRY:
You mean, we've gone back in time?

HERMIONE:
Yes.	Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment.	Clearly something happened he wants us to change.

HARRY:
(in admiration) Good punch.

HERMIONE:
Hurry!	Malfoy's coming!

DRACO:
Not a word of this to anyone, understood!	I'll get that jumped- up Mudblood one of these days. Mark my words...

HARRY:
Look.	Buckbeak's still alive.

HERMIONE:
Of course!	Remember what Dumbledore said.	If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.

HARRY:
Buckbeak?	But... how will saving Buckbeak help Sirius?

HERMIONE:
We'll see.

HARRY:
Here they come.	I better hurry.

HERMIONE:
No!	Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.	Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free!

HARRY:
That's Pettigrew --

HERMIONE:
No, Harry!	You can't!

HARRY:
Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents!	You don't expect me to just sit here...

HERMIONE:
Yes!	You Must! (pointing inside) Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut right now.	If you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad.	Awful things can happen when wizards meddle with time.	We can't be seen.

HERMIONE:
Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving?

HARRY:
Are you mad?

HERMIONE:
C'mon.	Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door.

HERMIONE:
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?

HARRY:
Shhh!

HERMIONE:
Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind.

HERMIONE:
Now, Harry!

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
'It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown...'

HARRY:
Get away!

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
'The Committee's appointed executioner shall dispatch the condemned by means of beheading...'

HARRY:
C'mon, Buckbeak.	Come on... Buckbeak refuses to move.

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
'As witnessed below.'	You sign here, Hagrid.	Very well, gentlemen.	Let's step outside, shall we...

DUMBLEDORE:
Excuse me, Minister.	I believe I must sign as well...

HERMIONE:
Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum... Harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's.	working. As Buckbeak trots after, the CAWING CROWS scatter. DING!

DUMBLEDORE:
Professor Dippet had those blackberries planted when he was Headmaster...

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
Let's get this over with, shall we?

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
But... where is it?	I just saw the beast not moments ago -- Hagrid?

HAGRID:
Beaky...

DUMBLEDORE:
(a hint of amusement) How extraordinary!

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
Come now, Dumbledore.	Someone's obviously released him.

HAGRID:
Professor, I swear!	I didn't!

DUMBLEDORE:
I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do with it, Hagrid.	How could you?	You've been with us all along.

CORNELIUS FUDGE:
We should search the grounds --

DUMBLEDORE:
Search the skies if you must, Minister.	In the meantime, I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea, Hagrid.	Or... a large brandy. (to the Executioner) It seems your services will no longer be required.

HARRY:
And we do that... how?

HERMIONE:
No idea.

HERMIONE:
Look.	It's Lupin.

HARRY:
Wait until Fred and George hear about that one.

HERMIONE:
Here comes Snape.

HARRY:
And now we wait.

HERMIONE:
Now we wait.

HERMIONE:
'Least someone's enjoying himself.

HARRY:
Before.	Down by the lake.	When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the Dementors go away...

HERMIONE:
With a Patronus.	I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital.	According to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.

HARRY:
It was my Dad. Hermione looks at Harry.

HARRY:
It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus.

HERMIONE:
But, Harry, your Dad's...

HARRY:
Dead.	I know.	I'm just telling you what I saw.

HERMIONE:
Here we come.

HARRY:
You see Sirius talking to me? He's asking me to come live with him.

HARRY:
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's.	I'm going to tell him I'd like to live someplace in the country.	I think he'd like that, after all those years in Azkaban.	We don't need a big place and I can help him... A HOWL pierces the night.	Hermione glances toward the Willow.

HERMIONE:
It's happened.	Lupin's transformed.

HARRY:
Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night.	While we just stand here...

HARRY:
What are you doing?

HERMIONE:
Saving your life.

HARRY:
Thanks.	But we have to move.

HERMIONE:
Why?

HARRY:
Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way.

HERMIONE:
Buckbeak.	We've got to find him.

HERMIONE:
Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night...

HERMIONE:
This is horrible...

HARRY:
Don't worry.	My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any minute... he'll conjure the Patronus

HERMIONE:
No one's coming, Harry...

HARRY:
HE WILL!	He will come!

HERMIONE:
No one's coming!	You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming!

HARRY:
You were right, Hermione.	It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.	It was... me.	I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.	I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd already done it.	Does that make sense?

HERMIONE:
No. (looking down in fear) But I don't like this!

HERMIONE:
Out of the way! (raising her wand) Alohomora! Sirius tests the IRON DOOR.	Still locked.

HERMIONE:
Didn't really expect that to work.

HERMIONE:
Dunamis!	Liberare!	Annihilare! Emancipare!

SIRIUS BLACK:
You might try --

HERMIONE:
Quiet!	I'm trying to think.

HERMIONE:
BOMBARDA!

SIRIUS BLACK:
That'll do.

SIRIUS BLACK:
You truly are your father's son, Harry!

SIRIUS BLACK:
I'll be forever grateful for this. To both of you.

HARRY:
I want to go with you.

SIRIUS BLACK:
One day perhaps.	For some time... life will be too.	unpredictable. Besides, you're meant to be here. Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye.

SIRIUS BLACK:
But promise me something, Harry.

HARRY:
Anything.

SIRIUS BLACK:
Trust yourself.	No matter the challenges you face -- and I fear they will be many -- you'll be surprised how many times you can find the answers... (tapping his heart) ...here.

SIRIUS BLACK:
A shooting star.	Make a wish.

HERMIONE:
We have to go. (CONTINUED)

OMITTED:
141 thru 143

DUMBLEDORE:
By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.

DUMBLEDORE:
Did what?

RON:
How'd you two get over there?	I was just talking to you... over there.

HERMIONE:
What d'you think, Harry?	Too much for him -- everything that's happened tonight?

HARRY:
Afraid so.	Always been a bit of the nervous type, Ron has.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Hello, Harry. Harry JUMPS.	Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Saw you coming.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
I've looked worse, believe me.

HARRY:
You've been sacked.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Resigned, actually.

HARRY:
Resigned!	But why!

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
It seems that someone has let slip the nature of my condition.

HARRY:
Snape.

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Whoever.	It was bound to get out. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving.	Parents will not want a -- someone like me -- teaching their children.

HARRY:
But Dumbledore --

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Has already risked enough on my behalf.	Besides, people like me, well... let's just say I'm used to this by now.	But before I go, tell me about your Patrons.

HARRY:
Well. At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it was --

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
There are stories about him and your mother, you know. Some are even true.	But I think it's safe to say, in the end, you'll know them best by getting to know yourself. Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand. (CONTINUED)

PROFESSOR LUPIN:
Mischief managed.

HALL:
- DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 149

RON:
Stand back, I said!	I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!

NEVILLE:
Harry!	Wherever did you get it!

SEAMUS:
Can I have a go, Harry?	After you, of course --

RON:
Quiet! (as they oblige) Thank you.	Let the man through.

HARRY:
Whose is that?

RON:
(as everyone laughs) Whose is it?	It's yours, mate.

HARRY:
But... how?	Who?

HERMIONE:
It's a mystery.	Though... this fell out of the wrapping. Harry turns, sees Hermione holding up a FEATHER.

HARRY:
That's a Hippogriff feather -- As Harry stops short, Hermione raises her eyebrow.	As they share a secret glance, we... CUT TO: 150	INT./EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT DOORS - DAY	150 BOOM!	The huge vertical DOORS BURST OPEN and Harry, trailed by the others, exits with the Firebolt.	As he strides off, others join the assembly -- Hagrid, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the commotion is all about. 151	EXT. COURTYARD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)	151 As Harry stops, an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment.

SEAMUS:
Go on, Harry.

NEVILLE:
Yeah.	Let's see.

HARRY:
Oh, come on now.	It's just a broom.

HAGRID:
(nodding sagely) Just a broom.

HARRY:
The fastest broom in the world. As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we -- CUT TO:

HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE

OLD MAN:
Bloody kids.

WORMTAIL:
Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..

VOLDEMORT:
NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.

UNKNOWN MAN:
I will not disappoint you my lord.

VOLDEMORT:
Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign.

VOLDEMORT:
Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.

VOLDEMORT:
Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

HERMIONE:
Harry!

HERMIONE:
Are you alright?

HARRY:
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?

HERMIONE:
Just now. You?

HARRY:
Last night.

HERMIONE:
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!

RON:
Bloody hell.

HERMIONE:
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.

HARRY:
Where are we actually going?

RON:
Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?

ARTHUR:
Haven't the foggiest, keep up!

AMOS:
Arthur! It's about time son.

ARTHUR:
Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?

CEDRIC:
Yes sir.

AMOS:
Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.

HARRY:
Yes sir. This way.

AMOS:
Great great pleasure.

HARRY:
Pleasure to meet you too sir.

ARTHUR:
That's it sir, just over there.

AMOS:
Shall we? We don't want to be late.

HARRY:
Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?

FRED:
That isn't just any old manky boot mate.

GEORGE:
It's a portkey.

AMOS:
Time to go. Ready?

HARRY:
What's a 'portkey'?

AMOS:
After 3. One... Two...

ARTHUR:
Harry!

AMOS:
Three!

ARTHUR:
Let go kids!

HERMIONE:
What??

ARTHUR:
Let! Go!

ARTHUR:
I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?

HARRY:
Thanks.

ARTHUR:
Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!

AMOS:
Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match.

HARRY:
See ya later Cedric.

ARTHUR:
Home sweet home.

ARTHUR:
Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.

TWINS:
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.

ARTHUR:
Feet off the table.

TWINS:
Feet off the table.

HARRY:
(Smiling) I love magic.

RON:
Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?

LUCIUS:
Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know

DRACO:
Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.

LUCIUS:
Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.

ARTHUR:
Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.

GEORGE:
Come on!

FRED:
It's the Irish!

GEORGE:
Here come the Bulgarians!

WEASLEYS:
Krum!!!

GEORGE:
Yes!

ANNOUNCER:
Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!

RON:
There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.

GINNY:
Think you're in love Ron?

TWINS:
(Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!

BOYS:
When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!

FRED:
Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.

ARTHUR:
Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.

ARTHUR:
Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.

RON:
Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.

HARRY:
What is THAT?

ARTHUR:
Stop! That's my son.

ARTHUR:
Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?

BARTY:
Which of you conjured this?

ARTHUR:
You can't possibly..

BARTY:
Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!

HARRY:
Crime?

ARTHUR:
Barty, they're just kids.

HARRY:
What crime?

HERMIONE:
Harry it's his mark.

HARRY:
Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers.

BARTY:
Follow me.

HARRY:
There was a man. Before. There.

BARTY:
All of you, this way.

ARTHUR:
Harry, who?

HARRY:
I dunno. I didn't see his face.

LADY OFFSCREEN:
Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?

LADY:
Anything from the trolley dears?

RON:
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.

RON:
On second thought, just the drewbals.

HARRY:
It's alright I'll get it.

RON:
Just the drewbals, thanks.

CHO:
Two pumpkin pasties please.

CHO:
Thank you.

LADY:
Anything sweet for you dear?

HARRY:
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.

HERMIONE:
This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?

RON:
Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.

HERMIONE:
It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.

HARRY:
I'm fine.

HERMIONE:
You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.

HAGRID:
Clear the runway.

HARRY:
Well there's something you don't see every day.

DUMBLEDORE:
Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...

DUMBLEDORE:
So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime.

STUDENT:
Blimey, that's one big woman.

DUMBLEDORE:
And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.

RON:
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!

IGOR:
Albus!

DUMBLEDORE:
Igor.

MADAME MAXIME:
Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to.

DUMBLEDORE:
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.

MADAME MAXIME:
But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey.

MAN:
You idiot!

DUMBLEDORE:
Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.

FRED:
Wicked.

DUMBLEDORE:
For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.

RON:
Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.

HERMIONE:
Alastor Moody? The aura.

RON:
He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.

DUMBLEDORE:
My dear old friend, thanks for coming.

PUPIL:
What's that he's drinking do you suppose?

HARRY:
I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.

BARTY:
After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.

GEORGE:
That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!

DUMBLEDORE:
Silence!

DUMBLEDORE:
The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun.

HERMIONE:
Three sir.

HERMIONE:
Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...

PUPIL:
Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head.

RON:
Yes...

RON:
Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.

NEVILLE:
There's the um... The cruciatus curse.

HERMIONE:
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!

RON:
Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.

HERMIONE:
There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.

HERMIONE:
Neville?

RON:
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.

HARRY:
Yeah well rather you than me.

GEORGE:
Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.

FRED:
Cooked it up just this morning.

HERMIONE:
It's not going to work.

FRED:
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.

HERMIONE:
You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.

FRED:
So?

HERMIONE:
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.

GEORGE:
That's why it's so brilliant.

GEORGE:
Ready Fred?

FRED:
Ready George?

GEORGE:
You said..

DUMBLEDORE:
Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!

DUMBLEDORE:
The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!

DUMBLEDORE:
The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour

DUMBLEDORE:
The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.

DUMBLEDORE:
Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry Potter. Harry Potter?

HAGRID:
No... No.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry Potter!

HERMIONE:
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.

VOICE:
He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?

HARRY:
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?

HARRY:
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
You're absolutely sure?

HARRY:
Yes sir.

MADAME MAXIME:
Well of course he is lying.

IGOR:
You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.

DUMBLEDORE:
That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.

BARTY:
The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion.

MCGONAGALL:
This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?

DUMBLEDORE:
What do you suggest Minerva?

MCGONAGALL:
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.

DUMBLEDORE:
You heard Barty the rules are clear.

MCGONAGALL:
Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...

SEVERUS:
Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold.

MCGONAGALL:
Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.

DUMBLEDORE:
I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?

DUMBLEDORE:
Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.

RON:
How did you do it?

RON:
Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.

HARRY:
Let you know what?

RON:
You know bloody well what.

HARRY:
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.

RON:
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.

HARRY:
I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.

RON:
Piss off.

RITA:
What a charismatic quartet. Hello!

RITA:
I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely.

RITA:
This is cosy.

HARRY:
It's a broomcupboard.

RITA:
You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?

HARRY:
Oh, no.

RITA:
So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve..

HARRY:
I'm fourteen.

RITA:
...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?

HARRY:
I dunno I haven't really thought about it.

RITA:
Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...

HARRY:
Fourteen.

RITA:
The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.

HARRY:
No I didn't enter.

RITA:
Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish.

HARRY:
(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.

SIR:
(VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....

HARRY:
AGH!

SIR:
(VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites.

HARRY:
Sirius?

RITA:
(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his...

HARRY:
Sirius?! How...

SIR:
I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?

HARRY:
No!

SIR:
Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?

HARRY:
I dunno.

SIR:
You didn't hear a name?

HARRY:
No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.

SIR:
What was that?

HARRY:
He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?

SIR:
Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.

HARRY:
What are you saying?

SIR:
I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.

HARRY:
Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?

SIR:
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.

HARRY:
I'm not ready for this Sirius.

SIR:
You don't have a choice.

HARRY:
Someone's coming!

SIR:
Keep your friends close Harry.

RON:
Who you talking to?

HARRY:
Who says I was talking to anyone.

RON:
I heard voices.

HARRY:
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.

RON:
You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.

NEVILLE:
Amazing. Amazing.

HARRY:
Neville! You're doing it again!

NEVILLE:
Oh, right sorry.

HARRY:
(reading a book) Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?

NEVILLE:
Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.

HERMIONE:
(Whispering to Ron) We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?

HERMIONE:
Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.

HARRY:
Is that right? Well.... what?

HERMIONE:
Uhhh...

HERMIONE:
Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.

HARRY:
Well you can tell Ronald...

HERMIONE:
I'm NOT an owl!

HAGRID:
Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?

HARRY:
Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?

HAGRID:
You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.

HARRY:
What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?

HAGRID:
As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.

MADAME MAXIME:
Hagrid?

HAGRID:
Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.

HAGRID:
Bonsoir Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME:
Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me.

HAGRID:
Couldn't forget you Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME:
What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.

HAGRID:
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

MADAME MAXIME:
Ahh, c'est magnifique!

MADAME MAXIME:
Can we get closer?

HARRY:
Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.

HAGRID:
Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.

HAGRID:
Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.

HARRY:
Ron was here?

HAGRID:
Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?

HARRY:
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.

BOY:
Cedric rules!

HARRY:
Thanks.

BOY:
Like the badge?

HARRY:
Excuse me..

HARRY:
(to Cedric) Can I have a word?

CEDRIC:
Alright.

HARRY:
Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.

CEDRIC:
Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

HARRY:
Yes.

CEDRIC:
Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them.

HARRY:
Don't worry about it.

HARRY:
(To Ron) You're a right foul git you know that?

RON:
You think so?

HARRY:
I know so.

RON:
Anything else?

HARRY:
Yeah. Stay away from me.

RON:
Fine.

DRACO:
Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last FIVE.

HARRY:
I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.

MCGONAGALL:
Professor Moody what are you doing?

MCGONAGALL:
Is that a student?

DRACO:
My father will hear about this!

MCGONAGALL:
We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.

MCGONAGALL:
Well you will do well to remember it.

HARRY:
Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...

HARRY:
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.

HARRY:
But I'm not allowed a broom.

HERMIONE:
Pssst! Harry? Is that you?

HARRY:
Yeah.

HERMIONE:
How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...

HARRY:
Battle a dragon.

RITA:
Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.

VIKTOR:
(To Rita) You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends.

RITA:
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

DUMBLEDORE:
Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate.

DUMBLEDORE:
What are you doing here Miss Granger?

HERMIONE:
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.

DUMBLEDORE:
Barty. The bag.

BARTY:
Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...

BARTY:
The welsh green. Mr Krum...

BARTY:
The chinese fireball. Oooooh.

BARTY:
The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...

HARRY:
The horntail...

BARTY:
What's that boy?

HARRY:
Nothing.

BARTY:
The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?

DUMBLEDORE:
Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...

DUMBLEDORE:
(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.

HERMIONE:
Your wand harry! Your wand!

GEORGE:
We knew you wouldn't die Harry.

FRED:
Lose a leg.

GEORGE:
Or an arm.

FRED:
Pack it in altogether.

TWINS:
NEVER!

SEAMUS:
Go on Harry, what's the clue?

HARRY:
Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?

HARRY:
What the bloody hell was that?

FRED:
Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.

RON:
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.

HARRY:
Caught on have you. Took you long enough.

RON:
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.

HARRY:
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.

RON:
At least I warned you about the dragons.

HARRY:
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

RON:
Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.

HARRY:
Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.

RON:
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.

HERMIONE:
Boys.

HERMIONE:
(Reading a newspaper) Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.

NIGEL:
Parcel for you Mr Weasley.

RON:
Thank you Nigel.

RON:
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.

RON:
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??

HARRY:
Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?

RON:
Ginny these must be for you.

GINNY:
I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.

RON:
What are you on about?

HERMIONE:
They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.

RON:
Dress robes? for what?

MCGONAGALL:
The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.

MCGONAGALL:
Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.

FRED:
(Whispering to George) Try saying that five times faster.

MCGONAGALL:
(Continued) Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight.

RON:
(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.

MCGONAGALL:
Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me.

MCGONAGALL:
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

RON:
Where?

MCGONAGALL:
My waist.

MCGONAGALL:
Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...

MCGONAGALL:
One two three, one two three, one two three.

HARRY:
(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?

TWINS:
Never.

MCGONAGALL:
Everybody come together.

MCGONAGALL:
Boys, on your feet.

HARRY:
Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...

RON:
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?

HARRY:
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

HAGRID:
I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser.

HAGRID:
And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!

RON:
This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.

RON:
Well, us and Neville!

HARRY:
But then again he can take himself.

HERMIONE:
It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.

RON:
Now I'm really depressed.

RON:
Well Hermione, you're a girl.

HERMIONE:
Oh well spotted.

RON:
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.

HERMIONE:
I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.

RON:
Bloody hell.

RON:
Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

HARRY:
Agreed.

CHO:
Harry!

HARRY:
Cho!

CHO:
Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top.

HARRY:
Ok thanks. Cho?

CHO:
Yes?

HARRY:
Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?

CHO:
Sorry? I didn't catch that.

HARRY:
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.

CHO:
Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.

HARRY:
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.

CHO:
Harry I really am sorry.

HARRY:
What happened to you?

GIRL:
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

HERMIONE:
What?

HARRY:
What did she say?

HERMIONE:
No of course.

HERMIONE:
She said yes??

HARRY:
Don't be silly.

RON:
There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.

GIRL:
Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening.

HARRY:
What did you do then?

RON:
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.

PATILS:
Hi Harry.

HARRY:
Hey!

RON:
Bloody hell.

RON:
What are those??

HARRY:
My dress robes.

RON:
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.

HARRY:
Well I expect yours are more traditional.

RON:
Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.

RON:
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.

HARRY:
Leave it alone.

RON:
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.

HARRY:
Who?

RON:
Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

HARRY:
Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.

RON:
Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.

PARVATI:
Hello boys. Don't you look...

PARVATI:
... dashing.

MCGONAGALL:
Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?

HARRY:
Ready professor?

MCGONAGALL:
To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.

HARRY:
No.

MCGONAGALL:
Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil.

PARVATI:
She looks beautiful.

HARRY:
Yeah she does.

PADMA:
(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??

RON:
No. Absolutely not.

PARVATI:
Harry. Take my waist.

HARRY:
What?

PARVATI:
Now.

HERMIONE:
Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?

RON:
No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.

HERMIONE:
What's got your wand in a knot?

RON:
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.

HERMIONE:
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.

RON:
Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.

PADMA:
Are you going to ask me to dance or not?

RON:
No.

RON:
(To Hermione) He's using you.

HERMIONE:
How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.

RON:
Doubt it. He's way too old.

HERMIONE:
What? What? That's what you think?

RON:
Yeah that is what I think.

HERMIONE:
You know the solution then don't you.

RON:
Go on.

HERMIONE:
Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.

RON:
Well that's completely off the point. Harry...

HERMIONE:
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.

RON:
They get scary when they get older.

HERMIONE:
Ron you spoil everything!

VOLDERMORT:
Let me see it again.

VOLDEMORT:
Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!

NEVILLE:
You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!

HERMIONE:
Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.

HARRY:
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.

HERMIONE:
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?

HARRY:
What's that supposed to mean?

HERMIONE:
I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.

CEDRIC:
Hey Potter.

HARRY:
Cedric.

CEDRIC:
How are you?

HARRY:
Spectacular.

CEDRIC:
Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.

HARRY:
Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.

CEDRIC:
Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?

CEDRIC:
It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.

HARRY:
I must be out of my mind.

MYRTLE:
I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.

HARRY:
Myrtle!

MYRTLE:
Long time no see.

MYRTLE:
I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?

HARRY:
Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?

MYRTLE:
Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric.

MYRTLE:
Well go on, open it.

VOICE SINGING:
Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took.

HARRY:
Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?

MYRTLE:
Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone...

HERMIONE:
Harry, tell me again.

HARRY:
Come seek us where our voices sound.

HERMIONE:
The black lake, that's obvious.

HARRY:
An hour long you'll have to look.

HERMIONE:
Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic

HARRY:
Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?

HERMIONE:
Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.

HERMIONE:
But sir, the second task is only hours away and...

NEVILLE:
You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?

HARRY:
Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.

NEVILLE:
I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.

HARRY:
You're sure about this Neville.

NEVILLE:
Absolutely.

HARRY:
For an hour.

NEVILLE:
Most likely.

HARRY:
Most likely?

NEVILLE:
Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.

HARRY:
You're telling me this now? You must be joking.

NEVILLE:
I just wanted to help.

HARRY:
Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?

NEVILLE:
You seem a little tense Harry.

HARRY:
Do I?

DUMBLEDORE:
(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own.

DUMBLEDORE:
(Continued) You may begin at the start of the cannon.

SEAMUS:
What's the matter with him?

FRIEND:
I don't know I can't see him.

NEVILLE:
Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!

DUMBLEDORE:
(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.

HARRY:
But she's my friend too!

MERPERSON:
Only one.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry!

BARTY:
Get him another towel.

DUMBLEDORE:
I want all the judges over here now.

FLEUR:
(To Harry) You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!

FLEUR:
Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron). You helped!

RON:
Well... yeah... a bit

RON:
Merci.

HERMIONE:
Harry!

HARRY:
Hermione

HERMIONE:
Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.

HARRY:
I finished last Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Next to last.

DUMBLEDORE:
Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!

DUMBLEDORE:
For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre.

FRED:
All that moral fibre eh?

RON:
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.

GEORGE:
Well done 'moral fibre'.

BARTY:
Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.

HAGRID:
So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.

RON:
We're still misfits.

HAGRID:
Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!

HARRY:
Mr Crouch?

DUMBLEDORE:
A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action.

FUDGE:
I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE:
Then for once show them some.

FUDGE:
The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.

DUMBLEDORE:
But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.

FUDGE:
What did you say? What did you say to me?

FUDGE:
Harry! Harry how good to see you again.

HARRY:
I can come back later Professor.

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.

HARRY:
Agh!

HARRY:
Professor?

MAN:
Professor.

BARTY:
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?

IGOR:
I do sir.

BARTY:
What do you wish to present?

IGOR:
I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.

BARTY:
Mr Rosier is dead.

IGOR:
Dead?

IGOR:
I didn't know.

BARTY:
If that is all the witness has to offer...

IGOR:
No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.

BARTY:
Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.

IGOR:
Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.

BARTY:
Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.

IGOR:
NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape.

DUMBLEDORE:
The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.

IGOR:
It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.

BARTY:
Silence!

BARTY:
Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.

IGOR:
Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.

BARTY:
What's that?

IGOR:
The name...

BARTY:
Yes?

IGOR:
I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...

BARTY:
The name! Give me the wretched name!

IGOR:
Barty Crouch! ... Junior.

BARTY JR:
Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.

BARTY:
You are no son of mine.

BARTY JR:
GAHHHH!

DUMBLEDORE:
Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.

HARRY:
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?

DUMBLEDORE:
He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?

HARRY:
It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.

DUMBLEDORE:
Have there been other dreams like this?

HARRY:
Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?

DUMBLEDORE:
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...

DUMBLEDORE:
Cast them away.

IGOR:
It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I.

SEVERUS:
Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?

HARRY:
Yes sir.

SEVERUS:
Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?

HARRY:
Bubble juice sir?

SEVERUS:
Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.

HARRY:
I haven't stolen anything.

SEVERUS:
Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.

DUMBLEDORE:
Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...

DUMBLEDORE:
(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...

DUMBLEDORE:
(continued) The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round.

DUMBLEDORE:
(To the contestants) In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.

DUMBLEDORE:
On the count of three... ONE...

HARRY:
Fleur? Fleur!

CEDRIC:
Get down!

HARRY:
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.

CEDRIC:
Get off me!

HARRY:
He's bewitched!

CEDRIC:
Harry! Harry!

CEDRIC:
You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.

HARRY:
For a moment so did I.

CEDRIC:
Some game huh?

HARRY:
Some game.

CEDRIC:
Go. Take it, you saved me!

HARRY:
Together, on three. One, two, three!

CEDRIC:
You ok?

HARRY:
Yeah, you?

CEDRIC:
Where are we?

HARRY:
I've been here before.

CEDRIC:
It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.

HARRY:
I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!

CEDRIC:
What are you talking about?

CEDRIC:
What is it?

HARRY:
Get back to the cup!

CEDRIC:
Who are you? What do you want?

VOLDEMORT:
Kill the spare.

HARRY:
Cedric!

VOLDEMORT:
Do it, now!

WORMTAIL:
Bones of the father, unwillingly given.

WORMTAIL:
Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.

WORMTAIL:
Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.

WORMTAIL:
The dark lord shall rise again.

VOLDEMORT:
My wand Wormtail.

VOLDEMORT:
Hold out your arm.

WORMTAIL:
Master. Thank you master.

VOLDEMORT:
The other arm Wormtail.

VOLDEMORT:
Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.

VOLDEMORT:
Not even you, Lucius.

LUCIUS:
My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts.

VOLDEMORT:
There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.

LUCIUS:
I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask.

WORMTAIL:
I returned.

VOLDEMORT:
Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.

WORMTAIL:
Thank you master, thank you.

VOLDEMORT:
(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome boy.

HARRY:
Don't touch him.

VOLDEMORT:
Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!

VOLDEMORT:
Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!

VOLDEMORT:
That's better. And now...

VOLDEMORT:
Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.

VOLDEMORT:
Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.

HARRY:
Have it your way.

VOLDEMORT:
Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!

CEDRIC:
(voice) Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father.

VOLDEMORT:
No!

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry! Harry!

DUMBLEDORE:
Tell me what happened!

HARRY:
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there.

DUMBLEDORE:
It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.

FUDGE:
Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people.

AMOS:
Let me through! That's my son! My boy!

HARRY:
Not so much now.

HARRY:
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.

HARRY:
Who?

HARRY:
I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.

HARRY:
Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.

HARRY:
It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...

DUMBLEDORE:
Severus...

DUMBLEDORE:
Do you know who I am?

DUMBLEDORE:
Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?

DUMBLEDORE:
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry get away from there!

DUMBLEDORE:
Are you alright Alastor?

ALASTOR:
I'm sorry Albus.

HARRY:
That's Moody, but then who's...?

SEVERUS:
Polyjuice potion.

DUMBLEDORE:
Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.

DUMBLEDORE:
We'll get you up in a minute.

DUMBLEDORE:
Barty Crouch Junior.

BARTY JR:
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

DUMBLEDORE:
Your arm Harry.

BARTY JR:
You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.

DUMBLEDORE:
Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

BARTY JR:
I'll be welcomed back like a hero.

DUMBLEDORE:
Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.

DUMBLEDORE:
(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end.

DUMBLEDORE:
I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.

HARRY:
Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.

DUMBLEDORE:
Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.

DUMBLEDORE:
No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.

VIKTOR:
Write to me. Promise.

HERMIONE:
Bye.

FLEUR:
Au revoir Ron.

RON:
Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?

HERMIONE:
No.

HARRY:
No I don't think so.

HERMIONE:
Everything's going to change now isn't it?

HARRY:
Yes.

HERMIONE:
Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.

RON:
Well I won't. You know I won't!

HERMIONE:
Harry will won't you?

HARRY:
Yeah. Every week.

HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX

MALCOLM:
...squealed like a pig, didn't he?

PIERS:
Brilliant punch, Big D; d'you see his face? Harry peers over the paper at the approaching DUDLEY DURSLEY, his physique newly-transformed into that of a burly boxer. He is surrounded by his equally big and stupid GANG. Harry hesitates...then impulsively lowers the paper.

HARRY:
Hey "Big D." Beat up another ten year old? Dudley falters as he sees Harry--glances anxiously at his mates--then quickly puffs up his chest.

DUDLEY:
This one deserved it.

HARRY:
Four against one. Very brave.

DUDLEY:
Yeah, well you're one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night. At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

HARRY:
What are you talking about?

DUDLEY:
"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!" Who's Cedric--your boyfriend? Harry pales. The GANG HOOTS, fueling Dudley's bravado.

DUDLEY:
"Dad! Help me, Dad!"

HARRY:
Shut up. THUNDER CRACKS. The other boys peer uneasily at the sky.

DUDLEY:
He's going to kill me, Mum!

HARRY:
Shut up Dudley, I'm warning you--! In his anger Harry pulls out his WAND. Dudley freezes at the sight--the GANG exchanges confused looks-- A STIFF WIND suddenly kicks up, blowing Harry's hair from his scar. Dudley looks up at the sky--where UNEARTHLY DARK CLOUDS are coalescing.

DUDLEY:
Wh-what are you doing?

HARRY:
I'm not doing anything. The WIND grows stronger, bangs the swings crazily as Dudley's GANG exchanges worried looks--and bolts. Dudley stares helplessly after them-- LIGHTNING splits the sky. A SIZZLING drop of RAIN hits the pavement. Another. Harry and Dudley look at each other--and run for it. 8	EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - DUSK	8 CRANE UP TO REVEAL the edge of the subdivision giving way to a RAISED DUAL CARRIAGEWAY, heavy with speeding

HARRY:
Oh no. The black skeletal figure of a DEMENTOR silently unfurls from the darkness above Harry--its bony fingers clutch Harry's neck and pull him out of frame with a strangled GASP, as his wand goes skittering away into darkness. Terrified, Dudley runs for it--right toward ANOTHER DEMENTOR floating eerily at the other end of the tunnel. HARRY looks around desperately for his wand as the Dementor begins to FEED on his lifeforce. He is fading fast. Finally he GASPS--

HARRY:
Lumos! A LIGHT FLARES in the shadows as his WAND TIP IGNITES.

HARRY:
Accio! The wand FLIES into his hand--

HARRY:
EXPECTO PATRONUM! A LUMINOUS SILVER STAG erupts from the tip of Harry's wand. Its antlers pierce the heart of the Dementor,

HARRY:
Mrs. Figg? ARABELLA FIGG wipes the gray flyaway hair from her eyes. Harry realizes his wand is out, quickly tries to hide it. MRS. FIGG Don't put away your wand, boy! (off Harry's confusion) They might come back! 11	EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT	11 Dudley MOANS miserably, tongue lolling. A last RUMBLE of THUNDER draws a nervous glance at the passing storm from Mrs. Figg, as Harry struggles with Dudley's dead weight. MRS. FIGG Dementors, in Little Whinging! What's next, Giants trodding the M4? The whole world's gone topsy- turvy. !

HARRY:
I don't understand. How do you know about--? MRS. FIGG Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

HARRY:
Dumbledore asked--you know Dumbledore--? MRS. FIGG After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year did you expect him to let you wander around on your own? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. They have arrived at Number Four Privet Drive. MRS. FIGG Now: get inside and stay there. I expect someone will be in touch soon, but whatever happens: don't leave the house! Harry opens his mouth to protest but Mrs. Figg, not unkindly, silences him with a POINTING FINGER. 12	INT. LIVING ROOM - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT	12 PETUNIA DURSLEY tears her eyes from the TV with a distracted smile.

AUNT PETUNIA:
Diddykins? Is that... She blanches as she sees Harry lugging Dudley inside. Dudley looks greenly up at his mother, opens his mouth to speak--and promptly vomits into a potted plant.

AUNT PETUNIA:
DIDDY! VERNON, come quick! VERNON DURSLEY, standing in front of the open freezer eating from a carton of ice cream, looks up vaguely. As he enters Dudley HEAVES into the plant again; Vernon grimaces in distaste.

AUNT PETUNIA:
We have to take him to Hospital!

UNCLE VERNON:
Who did this to you, boy? Dudley's shaking finger rises at Harry. Vernon approaches, brandishing the dripping spoon.

UNCLE VERNON:
Happy are we now?! You've finally done it! You've driven him loony!

AUNT PETUNIA:
Don't say that, Vernon!

UNCLE VERNON:
Look at him, Petunia! (Dudley stares droolingly up at her) He's off his chump! Puggles! Crackers! Our boy's gone yampy! (jabbing at Harry with his spoon) Well I've reached my limit, d'you hear? I've taken the last of your nonsense--! A sudden SCREECH makes everyone turn as an OWL DIVEBOMBS down the chimney, CAROMS off the hearth, LAUNCHES back into the air, drops a PARCHMENT ENVELOPE at Harry's feet--then ZOOMS erratically out the kitchen window. Vernon appeals helplessly to the heavens, emits a tiny, defeated SQUEAK. But Harry is staring down at the envelope--a PURPLE SEAL reads MINISTRY OF MAGIC. As he picks it up and opens it, a LETTER elaborately UNFOLDS ITSELF, as the WAX of the seal DEFORMS into a pair of thin, humorless LIPS:

MAFALDA HOPKIRK:
Dear Mr. Potter: The Ministry has received intelligence that at twenty-three minutes past six this evening you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping that you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk. With that the letter DISINTEGRATES into a cloud of PARTICLES, which spirals itself and VANISHES with a POP. Silence...and then Uncle Vernon's eyes narrow in vindictive triumph, as he turns on the stunned Harry:

UNCLE VERNON:
Justice. In the b.g., Dudley again heaves into the plant. 13	OMITTED	13 14	INT. HARRY'S ROOM - NIGHT	14 As we watch the car SQUEAL away PULL BACK to reveal Harry at the window. He POUNDS the wall in a burst of anger... HEDWIG turns her snowy head in alarm as the VIBRATION-- subtly, magically AMPLIFIED--sends a SHUDDER through the room--causing something to SHATTER behind Harry.

HARRY:
Sorry, Hedwig... Harry turns...bends down to find the moving PHOTO of JAMES and LILY POTTER, its glass broken. As he picks up the broken photo, for a moment Harry's frustration darkens to despair... LATER. Harry has fallen asleep on his bed. He twitches uneasily as we hear frightening WHISPERS grow...

VOLDEMORT:
Kill the spare.

TONKS:
Watch that, dangerous bit of carpet there... The WIND dies as the SILHOUETTES sag wearily.

MADEYE MOODY:
Tonks--for God's sake... A SILHOUETTE with a punk haircut trips into frame--

TONKS:
Very clean, these Muggles. Bit unnatural... --and completes the tableau. As she peers into the room the tip of her wand IGNITES, revealing a young WITCH with twinkling eyes and SHOCKING PINK HAIR.

TONKS:
Oh, this is better... Harry peers at another silhouette swigging from a flask...

HARRY:
Professor Moody? What are you doing here? Moody steps into the light as he wipes his mouth.

MADEYE MOODY:
Rescuing you, of course.

HARRY:
But where are we going? If I've been expelled from Hogwarts--

MADEYE MOODY:
You haven't been--not yet, anyway. Kingsley, you take point.

HARRY:
But--the letter said--

SHACKLEBOLT:
(passing Harry) Dumbledore's persuaded the Minister to suspend your expulsion-- Before Harry can respond Moody shoves him through the front door--

SHACKLEBOLT:
--pending a formal hearing.

HARRY:
A hearing--?

TONKS:
Don't worry, Harry. We'll explain everything when we get back to Headquarters--

MADEYE MOODY:
Shhh! Not here, Nymphadora. Tonks goes rigid--her HAIR MAGICALLY turning an angry RED, as she fixes Shacklebolt with a deadly look.

TONKS:
Don't. Call me. Nymphadora.

MADEYE MOODY:
(mounting his broom) Stay in formation everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

TONKS:
Stop being so cheerful, Madeye-- he'll think we're not taking this seriously...

MADEYE MOODY:
Get a move on, sonny! Madeye brusquely pushes Harry toward the sidewalk, raising his glowing WAND ahead of them-- --where a battered DOOR emerges between two houses... quickly followed by straining dirty WALLS and grimy WINDOWS, as a new building magically begins to push the houses on either side out of its way--

QUICK CUTS:
The water in the Goldfish Bowl VIBRATES slightly as the FISH SWISHES; but the couple doesn't look up from the TV-- Chimes gently TINKLE in the second window as the Boho Man's GIRLFRIEND joins him in the kitchen, and he holds up a spoon for her to taste...

BACK TO SCENE:
--the facade finishes expanding into place with a gentle POP...as the STEREO THUDS on, unperturbed.

HARRY:
Mrs. Weasley...?

HARRY:
(eyeing the door) Yeah, about that... MRS. WEASLEY No time to explain. Upstairs, first door on the left! 20	EXT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT	20 Harry takes in the PLAQUES of SHRUNKEN ELF HEADS as he climbs the stairs. As he reaches the landing he spots an elderly HOUSE ELF (KREACHER) rummaging furtively through a cabinet down the hall. He MUTTERS to himself:

KREACHER:
...mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves...if my poor Mistress knew the scum they've let into her house what would she say to old Kreacher...oh the shame... As Harry's foot CREAKS on the landing Kreacher turns in alarm--for a moment his eyes narrow viciously--then he quickly shuts the drawer, bitterly forces a nod, scuttles off. Harry frowns...then hears indistinct VOICES behind one of the doors. He cautiously approaches. opens it...as Hermione's hug nearly knocks him flat.

HERMIONE:
HARRY--!

HERMIONE:
Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack; you must tell us everything--

RON:
(grinning) Let the man breathe, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
--and this hearing at the Ministry--it's just outrageous! I've looked it up and they simply can't expel you! It's completely unfair!

HARRY:
Yeah, there's a lot of that going around. What is this place anyway? Hermione and Ron exchange a look as Harry looks around.

RON:
It's Headquarters...

HERMIONE:
...of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society; Dumbledore founded it back when they first fought You-Know-Who.

HARRY:
Couldn't have put any of this in a letter I suppose. I've gone all summer without any bloody news! Hermione and Ron share a guilty look--

RON:
We wanted to write mate, really we did--only--

HARRY:
Only what?

HERMIONE:
Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.

HARRY:
(stunned) Dumbledore said that? (they nod) But...why would he want to keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help! After all, I'm the one who saw Voldemort return; I'm the one who fought him. I'm the one who saw Cedric... Harry falters, suddenly emotional. Ron and Hermione exchange a concerned look--then POP--a grinning FRED and GEORGE WEASLEY APPARATE on either side of Harry.

FRED:
Harry.

GEORGE:
Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

FRED:
Don't bottle up your anger, Harry; let it out!

GEORGE:
Anyway if you're all done shouting--

FRED:
--want to hear something really interesting...?

SIRIUS:
...if it wasn't for Harry we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back! He isn't a child, Molly! MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.) ...Well he's not an adult either! He's not James, Sirius. We rapidly ASCEND the Ear's flesh-colored cord to the landing above--where the twins and the trio are gathered tightly around the other EAR. GINNY WEASLEY silently joins them, mouths "hi" to Harry.

SIRIUS:
Well he isn't your son! MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.) He's as good as! Who else has he got?

SIRIUS:
He's got me! Harry flushes with gratitude; Hermione smiles.

SNAPE:
How touchingly paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his Godfather.

SIRIUS:
You stay out of this, Snivellus--

HARRY:
Snape's part of the Order?

RON:
(nods, grim)

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
You're sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us all quite a turn. Harry opens his mouth to reply but before he can--

SIRIUS:
What, no hello for me? Harry turns to see a grinning Sirius, his long dark hair swept back from his glittering eyes.

HARRY:
Sirius. And for the first time since we've seen him...Harry smiles. As he and Sirius EMBRACE, tight-- 24	INT. BASEMENT KITCHEN - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT	24 A cauldron of STEW stirs itself; a KNIFE chops vegetables. Tonks entertains Ginny by transforming her nose into a beak, a Pig's snout. In the shadows Kreacher cleans up empties. Harry sits near Mr. Weasley, who frowns deeply at a PARCHMENT with a familiar PURPLE SEAL...

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
...this is most unusual...it seems Minister Fudge has called your hearing before the entire Wizengamot... He grimly hands the parchment to Lupin to examine it...

SIRIUS:
It's a set-up. A chance to publicly discredit Harry.

LUPIN:
I'm afraid you may be right, Padfoot...

HARRY:
I don't understand. What does the Ministry of Magic have against me? Silence. Tonks and Ginny frown; Ron and Hermione exchange an apprehensive look. Sirius hesitates...

MADEYE MOODY:
(quietly) Show him. He'll find out soon enough. Tonks reluctantly produces a copy of the Daily Prophet, hands it to Harry. A front-page editorial features Harry's photo; the headline reading: "Boy Who Lived" magically changes to "Boy Who Lies?" Harry is stunned. Sirius frowns...he knows exactly how Harry feels.

SIRIUS:
Fudge has been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power--including his influence at the Daily Prophet--to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.

HARRY:
But...why?

LUPIN:
The Minister thinks Dumbledore is after his job. That he's lying about Voldemort's return as a ploy to gain political power.

HARRY:
But that's insane! No one in their right mind would believe--

LUPIN:
Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It has been twisted and warped--by fear. (he stares into the fire) Fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now that he's returned...I'm afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

HARRY:
So what's Voldemort been up to-- seeing as everyone's so thoughtfully ignoring him? Lupin hesitates--glances up at Mrs. Weasley, who is looking at him pleadingly. He frowns...then reluctantly nods at Sirius, who turns to Harry:

SIRIUS:
We think he wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago he had huge numbers at his command-- not just witches and wizards but all manner of Dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same... (hesitates) But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. Moody's EYE SWIVELS instantly to Sirius--he CLEARS HIS THROAT loudly but Sirius ignores him, continues:

SIRIUS:
We think Voldemort may be after something--something he didn't have last time...

MADEYE MOODY:
(warns, low) Sirius--

HARRY:
You mean...like a weapon? MRS. WEASLEY THAT'S ENOUGH! (all eyes turn to Mrs. Weasley, wrought) He's only a boy! Say much more and you might as well induct him into the Order straightaway!

HARRY:
Good--I want to join. If Voldemort's building an army I want to fight. Sirius nods, proud. Lupin sighs deeply.

LUPIN:
I know, Harry. But for all you've been through, you're not an adult-- not yet. (hesitates) Still...if things continue the way they're going...I'm afraid before long you may get your chance.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Trains under the ground! So ingenious, these Muggles... (studying his map) This way, Harry--mustn't be late...

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Well! Here we are. He gestures "after you" to the bewildered Harry, then folds himself beside him into the telephone box.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
I've never used the visitor's entrance before. This should be fun!

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Sorry...let's see... M...A...G... I...C. For a moment nothing happens--and then the telephone box SHUDDERS, and with a dull GRINDING begins sinking into the ground. Harry watches in amazement as the pavement rises over the windows, and darkness closes over them. And then a chink of GOLDEN LIGHT illuminates Harry's feet, rises up his body toward his astonished eyes-- 30	INT. ATRIUM - MINISTRY OF MAGIC - DAY	30 The Ministry's splendid Lobby comes into view: walls lined with GILDED FIREPLACES, queues of WIZARDS arriving and departing in flashes of green light. At the end of the hall is an enormous GOLDEN FOUNTAIN depicting a group of MAGICAL CREATURES looking up at a noble WIZARD. A GIANT FIGURE of CORNELIUS FUDGE stares balefully down at Harry and Mr. Weasley as they thread their way through the sea of briefcase and newspaper-carrying MINISTRY WORKERS; several stop and stare as they recognize Harry. 31	INT. LIFT LOBBY - DAY	31 Harry and Mr. Weasley join a crowd squeezing into one of the golden-gated LIFTS. As they enter Harry peers in confusion at the HANGING STRAPS above them...then finds himself face to face with another Daily Prophet editorial: DUMBLEDORE: Daft or Dangerous? The WIZARD reading the paper peers suspiciously down at Harry, as a big-bearded WIZARD holding a large cardboard box squeezes in beside Mr. Weasley. Something in the box CACKLES, emits a small jet of FLAME, singeing the wizard's beard.

BOB:
'Morning Arthur.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
'Morning Bob. BOB absently brushes the ash from his beard as a FLOCK of pale violet PAPER AIRPLANES swoop into the lift, flap idly above Harry's head. Mr. Weasley confides:

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Interdepartmental memos. We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Merlin's Beard. Thank you Kingsley. (to Harry) They've changed the time of your hearing.

HARRY:
When is it?

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Five minutes ago. As Wizards automatically reach for hanging straps above them the lift suddenly plunges from view--

LIFT VOICE:
Department of Mysteries. Mr. Weasley pulls Harry out of the lift--and turns down a torch-lit corridor. HARRY'S POV: rounding a corner we glimpse CORNELIUS FUDGE conferring intently with LUCIUS MALFOY. They look up in surprise as Harry passes. Harry stares back--not noticing the PLAIN BLACK DOOR at the end of a long hallway beyond...

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
...now remember, during the hearing you must speak only when spoken too, and stay calm--you've done nothing wrong. As the Muggles say, the truth will out, yes...? They arrive at a large iron door. Harry starts in...but pauses as he sees Mr. Weasley isn't coming with him.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Not allowed in, I'm afraid. Good luck, Harry. Harry frowns...takes a deep breath...and enters the lion's den. We FOLLOW HIM in...

FUDGE:
Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August into offenses committed by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. On Fudge's left sits AMELIA BONES, peering curiously at Harry through her monocle. On his right sits a broad- faced WITCH dressed in pink. PERCY WEASLEY is in the row behind, taking notes.

FUDGE:
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister--

DUMBLEDORE:
--Witness for the defense-- All heads turn as ALBUS DUMBLEDORE strides serenely across the courtroom.

DUMBLEDORE:
--Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Harry lights up in relief. But Dumbledore avoids his gaze.

FUDGE:
Er. You got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you?

DUMBLEDORE:
I must have missed it. But due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. (helpfully) The charges?

FUDGE:
(a baleful beat, then:) The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions (MORE)

FUDGE:
produce a Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. (fiercely to Harry) Do you deny producing said Patronus?

HARRY:
No, but--

FUDGE:
Do you deny it was in the presence of a Muggle, one Dursley Dudley? (Percy leans down, whispers to him) Dudley Dursley?

HARRY:
No, but--

FUDGE:
--and you were aware you are forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?

HARRY:
Yes, but--

FUDGE:
(broadly) Witches and Wizards of the Wizengamot--

HARRY:
I only did it because of the Dementors! A HUSH falls over the room. AMELIA BONES peers at Harry over her monocle.

AMELIA BONES:
Dementors? In Little Whinging?

FUDGE:
Clever. Muggles can't see Dementors. Highly convenient.

HARRY:
I'm not lying! There were two of them, and if I hadn't--

FUDGE:
Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story, but as you can produce no witnesses--

DUMBLEDORE:
Pardon me, Minister, but as it happens...we can. ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER Mrs. Figg--in her Sunday best but still wearing carpet slippers--looks nervously up at the court.

AMELIA BONES:
Please describe the attack. What did they look like? MRS. FIGG Well...one was very large, and the other rather skinny--

FUDGE:
Not the boys, the Dementors. MRS. FIGG Oh. Right... Big...cloaked... (shivers) ...then everything went cold...as though all the happiness had gone from the world... Her voice trembles and dies. Amelia Bones raises an eyebrow at Fudge.

FUDGE:
Now look here! Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical--!

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh, I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence, Minister. The crowd MURMURS.

UMBRIDGE:
Hem hem...

FUDGE:
The chair recognizes Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge. The pink-dressed WITCH leans forward. She wears a black velvet bow and speaks in a fluttery, girlish voice: meet DOLORES UMBRIDGE.

UMBRIDGE:
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor. Dementors are, after all, under the control of (MORE)

UMBRIDGE:
the Ministry of Magic. So silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy! She laughs a chilling, silvery laugh.

DUMBLEDORE:
That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Undersecretary...which is why I'm confident the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban, and why they attacked without authorization. (turning to Fudge) Of course...there is another who might have been behind the attack. Fudge goes rigid. Dumbledore steps forward in a private appeal.

DUMBLEDORE:
Cornelius...I implore you to listen to reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontravert--

FUDGE:
HE'S. NOT. BACK! Silence! Fudge is quivering with rage; even Percy is taken aback. Dumbledore sighs deeply...then quietly addresses the Panel.

DUMBLEDORE:
In the matter of Harry Potter: the law plainly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life- threatening situations.

FUDGE:
Laws can be changed, Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE:
Clearly--if it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic. Some of the wizards shift uncomfortably in their seats.

AMELIA BONES:
Those in favor of clearing the witness of all charges?

AMELIA BONES:
Those in favor of conviction? Fudge and a half dozen others raise their hands, including Percy and Umbridge. Fudge's eyes narrow in impotent fury.

FUDGE:
Cleared of all charges. As the assembled adjourn Harry turns gratefully to Dumbledore--but the Headmaster is already sweeping away, leaving Harry staring uncomprehendingly after him. With a shiver of apprehension, Harry turns to find one motionless face in the risers, silently appraising him... Dolores Umbridge smiles a honeyed smile.

MADEYE MOODY:
Are you barking mad? You'll blow the entire operation--! The Dog GROWLS, pulls free of Moody's grip and slinks guiltily to an empty area of the platform. As Harry hurries after him into a WAITING ROOM we see through its OPAQUE GLASS the DOG TRANSFORM; his black fur becomes a shabby black overcoat cloaked around--

HARRY:
Sirius! What are you doing here?! If somebody sees you--

SIRIUS:
(grinning) Had to see you off, didn't I? Anyway what's life without a little risk?

HARRY:
I just don't want to see you chucked back in Azkaban!

SIRIUS:
Being trapped in that house day and night is almost as bad. Worst part about being a fugitive is how bloody boring it is... (softening) I take it back. The worst part is people believing everything they read in the papers... (Harry smiles gratefully) Anyway. I wanted you to have this. Sirius produces a tattered WIZARDING PHOTOGRAPH. In it a small CROWD OF WIZARDS wave and lift their glasses. Dumbledore is at center.

SIRIUS:
Original Order of the Phoenix.

HARRY:
You all look so young.

SIRIUS:
We were. (pointing) Marlene McKinnon; she was killed two weeks after this was taken; Voldemort wiped out her entire family... Frank and Alice Longbottom...

HARRY:
Neville's parents...

SIRIUS:
A fate worse than death, you ask me... FRANK and ALICE LONGBOTTOM smile happily out at us. Harry frowns...and then his breath catches as he spots JAMES and LILY POTTER. James has his arm around Sirius, who wears short hair and an innocent grin.

SIRIUS:
It's been fourteen years...and still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.

HARRY:
I wish I could have known him... Harry gazes at his father...then looks through the doorway at the sea of happy STUDENTS boarding the train, kissing PARENTS...all blissfully unaware.

HARRY:
Sirius...Do you really think there's going to be a war?

SIRIUS:
It feels like it did before. Like the calm before a storm. Harry shivers. Hands the photo back to Sirius--

SIRIUS:
You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now... Harry takes this in, chilled. He looks down at the photo. Innocent smiles from happier days. SOUND UPCUT: A TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS-- ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER STEAM BILLOWS from the Hogwarts Express. It begins to move. As Harry hurries to step onboard something catches his eye down the deserted platform... Time seems to slow; the air shimmers with dreamlike hyperclarity... VOLDEMORT stands at the end of the platform. Looking straight at Harry. His head slowly tilts--

THRU	THRU:
40	40 41	EXT. ROAD - HOGSMEADE STATION - NIGHT	41 A sign reads HOGSMEADE STATION. As the trio start down the path toward the Carriage Road Harry frowns: everywhere he looks his eyes are met with nervous glances, furtive WHISPERS...and copies of the Daily Prophet. DRACO MALFOY--flanked, as ever, by CRABBE and GOYLE, calls out:

DRACO MALFOY:
I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free, Potter. Better enjoy it while you can--I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it... He laughs...then, without warning Harry suddenly moves toward Draco. Draco flinches; a surprised Ron holds Harry back...

RON:
It's only Malfoy, Harry. What'd you expect...?

HARRY:
Just--stay away from me...

DRACO MALFOY:
What'd I tell you--complete nutter. MOMENTS LATER. As the trio approach the rain-washed road we see a CARRIAGE; inside is CHO CHANG and several GIRLFRIENDS. As Cho spots Harry she hesitates...nods shyly. Harry blanches--Ron and Hermione share a smile as the carriage RATTLES away...

NEVILLE:
Hi guys. NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM joins them, holding a pulsing CACTUS. HARRY, RON, HERMIONE Hey Neville. As the next carriage pulls up Harry turns toward it--and finds himself face to face with a large skeletal horse with pupil-less eyes and leathery wings: a THESTRAL. Harry stares in amazement.

HARRY:
What is it?

RON:
What's what?

HARRY:
That. Pulling the carriage. Ron and Hermione share a concerned look.

HERMIONE:
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself--like always. Harry turns back to the Thestral, SNORTING STEAM. And then a calm, dreamy voice speaks nearby:

LUNA:
You're not going mad... INSIDE THE CARRIAGE an upside-down magazine (The Quibbler) lowers to reveal LUNA LOVEGOOD, her wand tucked behind her ear. She studies Harry with wistful understanding, as if wanting to comfort him.

LUNA:
(smiling sympathetically) They've always pulled the carriages. Ron raises a dubious eyebrow as the others exchange glances...then shrug. Luna studies Harry as he climbs into the carriage.

LUNA:
You're Harry Potter.

HARRY:
(grim) Yeah, I know. Neville carefully climbs in with his CACTUS. LUNA I don't know who you are.

NEVILLE:
Oh, nobody, really.

HERMIONE:
(climbing in) No you're not; you're Neville Longbottom. Everyone, this is Loony Lov-- (mortified) Luna Lovegood. She's in Ginny's year, in Ravenclaw. Mumbled "hi's" all around as an utterly unperturbed Luna smiles, fingers her necklace of butterbeer corks. Hermione tries to make amends.

HERMIONE:
What an interesting necklace.

LUNA:
Oh thank you! It's a charm actually. (leans in, confides) Keeps away the Nargles. Hermione nods and smiles politely. Harry and Ron shoot her an inquisitive glance; Hermione surreptitiously shrugs--"no idea." Luna looks wistfully out the window.

LUNA:
Hungry. I hope there's pudding. As the carriage RATTLES off... 42	OMITTED	42 43	INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT	43 TRACK ALONG the HIGH TABLE, where PROFESSORS FLITWICK, MCGONAGALL and SNAPE are all are looking distinctly uncomfortable...

DUMBLEDORE:
...We have two changes in staffing this year. We are pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly- Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave... We reach an OVERSIZED EMPTY CHAIR-- AT THE GRYFFINDOR TABLE a troubled Harry looks inquiringly at Hermione, who shrugs, equally concerned... Continue TRACKING along the high table--where PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY--myopically trying to spear pieces of kipper with her fork--pauses to peer uncertainly at the person dining beside her...

DUMBLEDORE:
...We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher--Professor Dolores Umbridge. REVEAL Umbridge--in pink Alice band and matching cardigan--sitting beside Trelawney. Harry is stunned.

DUMBLEDORE:
[I'm sure I'm not alone in saying good luck, Professor...]

HERMIONE:
You know her?

HARRY:
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.

DUMBLEDORE:
...As usual, our Caretaker Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you--

UMBRIDGE:
Hem, hem.

UMBRIDGE:
Thank you Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me... (the STUDENTS blink back, nonplussed) I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends. FRED/GEORGE Oh that's likely... The twins SNORT in amusement...but then their grins wither under Umbridge's icy gaze. She briskly produces a parchment, reads in a sing-song voice.

UMBRIDGE:
The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The task of passing down the ancient skills must be undertaken with the utmost seriousness. Although each headmaster has brought something new to this historic school... A perfunctory nod at Dumbledore.

UMBRIDGE:
...progress for progress's sake must be discouraged. A balance then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation. We think she's done--the students EXHALE--

UMBRIDGE:
--Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected--and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. Hermione reacts with dawning alarm at this last...as Umbridge smiles primly, abruptly turns and goes, Dumbledore breaks the stunned silence by starting to clap, but the applause that joins him is meager at best.

DUMBLEDORE:
Thank you Professor Umbridge; that was most...illuminating. As I was saying, Mr. Filch has asked me...

DUMBLEDORE:
[...to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are any number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch's office door. First-years ought to know that the Forest in the grounds is out-of-bounds to students--and a few of our older students ought to know by now, too. Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the first weekend of next month...]

RON:
Illuminating? What a load of waffle!

HERMIONE:
There was important stuff hidden in that waffle. (off their confusion) "Progress must be discouraged?" "Prune practices that ought to be prohibited?"

HARRY:
What's it mean?

HERMIONE:
It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts. They all slowly look up at the smug, satisfied smile of Dolores Umbridge, as she carefully adjusts her bow.

HARRY:
Dean. Seamus. Good holiday?

DEAN THOMAS:
All right. Better than Seamus's anyway. Seamus looks uneasily at Harry, then:

SEAMUS:
Me Mam didn't want me to come back.

HARRY:
Why not?

SEAMUS:
Well...I suppose because of you. (Harry is stunned) The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you, Harry-- and Dumbledore as well...

HARRY:
And your Mum believes them?

SEAMUS:
Nobody knows what really happened the night Cedric died...

HARRY:
Then I guess you should read the Prophet like your stupid mother-- it'll tell you everything you need to know!

SEAMUS:
Don't you have a go at my mother!

HARRY:
I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar--!

RON:
(as he enters) What's going on?

SEAMUS:
He's mad is what's going on! Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who?

RON:
As a matter of fact, I do! So unless you want a fistful of Weasley you'll shut your mouth! (Seamus backs down) Anyone else got a problem with Harry?

NEVILLE:
(quietly) My Gran says it's the Daily Prophet that's rubbish. She's canceled our subscription. He looks up at Harry, who manages an awkward nod, then hurries up the stairs...

RON:
You all right?

HARRY:
(quietly furious) Fine.

RON:
Seamus was bang out of order, mate. But he'll come round, you'll see--

HARRY:
I said I'm fine, Ron! Ron stares at Harry. Harry's eyes are instantly apologetic...but something prevents him from saying the words. A complicated moment between the old friends. Ron sees the helpless look in Harry's eyes, but can't help being hurt.

RON:
Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then. He goes. Harry looks out the window... 45	INT. UMBRIDGE'S CLASSROOM - DAY	45 A paper SWALLOW swoops and dives overhead. It is before class; STUDENTS buzz with CHATTER and horseplay. As the SWALLOW banks around we see it is being expertly controlled by the wand of PADMA PATIL... The SWALLOW soars low over the class...then suddenly EXPLODES in a ball of flame. Dead silence. All eyes turn to Umbridge as she slowly lowers her stubby wand, smiles a honeyed smile.

UMBRIDGE:
Good morning, children! As she strides to the front of the room she aims her wand at a BLACKBOARD, flicks her wrist causing words to magically appear (stacked vertically) as she speaks them:

UMBRIDGE:
Ordinary. Wizarding. Level. Examinations... (turns) --more commonly known as OWLS. It is not an understatement to say your fifth-year examinations will (MORE)

UMBRIDGE:
in many respects determine your futures. Study hard and you will be rewarded! Fail to do so, and the consequences may be...severe. The remains of the singed swallow COLLAPSES into ash. A stack of TEXTBOOKS now FLOAT out of a cupboard and distribute themselves to the students, landing with a thud before them: "Dark Arts Defense: Basics for Beginners" over an outdated, childish illustration.

UMBRIDGE:
Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly... uneven. But you will be pleased to know that from now on you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic... Hermione has been paging through the textbook with growing alarm. She raises her hand. Umbridge nods.

HERMIONE:
There's nothing in here about actually using defensive spells.

UMBRIDGE:
(the silvery laugh) Using spells? I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.

RON:
(incredulous) We're not going to use magic? Umbridge ignores him, calls on Hermione's upthrust hand.

HERMIONE:
But surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts--

UMBRIDGE:
Wizards much older and cleverer than yourself have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way...

HARRY:
What use is that? If we're going to be attacked it won't be "risk free--"

UMBRIDGE:
Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. (instantly sweet) It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient to get you through your examinations--which, after all, is what school is all about.

HARRY:
And how's theory's supposed to prepare us for what's out there?

UMBRIDGE:
There is nothing out there, dear. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself?

HARRY:
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort? Hermione cringes. Umbridge freezes...then turns, splays her fingers on her desk as she surveys the room.

UMBRIDGE:
Let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.

HARRY:
It's not a lie. I saw him, I fought him--

UMBRIDGE:
Detention, Mr. Potter!

HARRY:
So according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?

UMBRIDGE:
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.

HARRY:
It was murder. Voldemort killed him and you know it--!

UMBRIDGE:
(volcanic) ENOUGH! The entire class FLINCHES--but in an instant the glimmer of madness vanishes from Umbridge's eye, and she has completely regained her poise. Sweetly:

UMBRIDGE:
Enough.

TRELAWNEY:
Dream Interpretation--

TRELAWNEY:
--a most important means of divination. For the inner eye sees sights to which the outer world is blind...

TRELAWNEY:
Oh! What are you doing here?

UMBRIDGE:
Oh don't mind me, dear... (she begins searching through her BAG) You see--Professor Trelawney, isn't it?--in addition to my teaching duties, the Ministry has asked me to act as an informal observer here at Hogwarts... (incensed, Trelawney draws breath to protest) Cornelius' eyes and ears, as it were... The silvery LAUGH as she produces a PARCHMENT [Educational Decree Number 12], which Trelawney blinks at uneasily. IN THE RISERS Harry frowns...

UMBRIDGE:
Nothing whatsoever to worry about of course. Please, do go on. I'm just a fly on the wall... Trelawney hesitates...finally turns back to the class.

TRELAWNEY:
Yes. Well--

UMBRIDGE:
Just one question dear. You've been in this post how long exactly?

TRELAWNEY:
Nearly sixteen years.

UMBRIDGE:
Quite a period...And it was Dumbledore who appointed you?

TRELAWNEY:
He did. Umbridge produces a CLIPBOARD, makes a SQUEAKY note. Trelawney can't help trying to peek but Umbridge pulls it away....nods for her to continue. Trelawney again starts to speak--double checks Umbridge--finally begins--

UMBRIDGE:
Just one more thing. If it isn't too much bother, would you please... predict something for me?

TRELAWNEY:
Sorry?

UMBRIDGE:
Predict something. Surely you're not surprised I ask. You would have foreseen it--no?

TRELAWNEY:
The--the Inner Eye does not See upon command!

UMBRIDGE:
Come now, one teensy little prophecy...No? Pity. Umbridge raises her pen to make a note--Trelawney panics--

TRELAWNEY:
I...I think I do see something... something dark... (a shaking finger rises) You are in grave danger! Umbridge raises a bland eyebrow...and makes a note. OFF HARRY--

UMBRIDGE:
...you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts Post, is that correct? Umbridge, clipboard in hand, serenely paces the back of the room. Hermione watches, frowns with growing concern.

UMBRIDGE:
But you were unsuccessful...?

SNAPE:
Obviously. Ron and Harry share a covert smile--Snape CUFFS Ron on the head.

UMBRIDGE:
Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?

SNAPE:
I suggest you ask him.

UMBRIDGE:
(sweetly) Oh, I shall. In fact... (her eyes fall on Harry) I believe I may have quite a lot to say to your esteemed Headmaster...in due time. Snape raises a surprised eyebrow, as the class reacts to this ominous note. Hermione frowns deeply--turns to look at Harry, who turns to take in Umbridge's cold smile. Harry SHIVERS--

UMBRIDGE:
Good evening, Mr. Potter. You know why you are here?

HARRY:
Pink. Er...yes. (a brief internal struggle) For talking back to a teacher... Umbridge raises an impressed eyebrow. But as she turns away Harry can't resist adding, soto:

HARRY:
And telling the truth.

UMBRIDGE:
(a slow smile) I'm the teacher, dear. I'll decide what the truth is. She indicates a desk against the wall; Harry sits.

UMBRIDGE:
You are going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter. (Harry opens his bag) No, not with your quill. You're going to be using a rather special one of mine. From behind her back she produces a long black quill with a razor-sharp point, hands it to Harry.

UMBRIDGE:
Now: I want you to write 'I must not tell lies.'

HARRY:
How many times?

UMBRIDGE:
Oh, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in. She starts back to her desk, as Harry realizes:

HARRY:
You haven't given me any ink.

UMBRIDGE:
Oh, you won't need ink. Uneasy, Harry begins to write. After a few words he stops, gasping in pain-- The words "I must not" have appeared on the parchment in gleaming red--and at the same time on the back of Harry's hand, as if cut into his skin with a scalpel. Harry stares as the cut magically heals over, leaving a faint trace of lettering on his reddened flesh. As Harry turns to stare at Umbridge she raises an eyebrow.

UMBRIDGE:
Yes?

HARRY:
(a long beat, then) Nothing. A spark of understanding dawns in Umbridge's eyes.

UMBRIDGE:
That's right. Because deep down, you know you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr. Potter... Harry stares as a disturbing, strangely intimate moment passes between them. Umbridge nods for him to continue. Harry begins to write, wincing in pain as the bloody letters glisten on the parchment... 48	INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT	48 A WIZARD'S WIRELESS blares the latest hit from Celestina Warbeck. FIND Neville sitting before his CACTUS. Using a quill pen, he surgically prods one of its PULSATING BOILS-- which promptly ERUPTS with thick green STINKSAP, covering Neville's face. He grimaces, sighs. Just beyond, Fred and George Weasley flank NIGEL, a young second-year. Fred holds a bright orange CANDY BOX; both he and George are focused intently on Nigel, slowly chewing and turning chartreuse. Beyond we may notice other VICTIMS in various forms of distress: nosebleeds, dizziness, violent sneezing, unconsciousness...

FRED:
...oh, now he's feeling it! (Nigel looks alarmed) Get it? Skiving snackboxes!

GEORGE:
Sweets to make you ill!

FRED:
Get out of class whenever you like!

GEORGE:
Extract hours of leisure from unprofitable boredom!

FRED:
Care for another? As Nigel races off to vomit George and Fred high-five. FIND Ron and Hermione entering, mid-conversation.

RON:
...I'm not asking you to write all of it for me, just...most of it.

HERMIONE:
All right; I'll do the introduction--but that's all.

RON:
Hermione you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met and if I'm ever rude to you again--

HERMIONE:
I'll know you're back to normal. They approach the fireplace, where Harry sits doing homework. He instinctively has the raw back of his hand to his mouth. Hermione is instantly maternal.

HERMIONE:
What's wrong with your hand?

HARRY:
(quickly hiding it) Nothing. Hermione's steely gaze will brook no quarter. Harry sighs, holds out his hand.

HERMIONE:
The other hand... Harry reluctantly complies. Ron and Hermione stare.

HERMIONE:
You've got to tell Dumbledore.

HARRY:
(uneasy) NO...I mean...Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now... Anyway I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.

RON:
Bloody hell Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this--!

HARRY:
Well I haven't got any of those, have I Ron!

HERMIONE:
Harry...You've got to report this. It's a simple matter of--

HARRY:
No it's not! Hermione reacts, surprised. Straining for measured tones, Harry struggles to explain:

HARRY:
Hermione...Whatever's going on here...it isn't simple.

HARRY:
You don't understand.

HERMIONE:
Then help us to. Harry looks at her helplessly...then rises, goes. Distressed, Ron and Hermione look after him... REVEAL Neville on the balcony above, a towel to his face, frowning. He's overheard it all.

HARRY:
Dear Padfoot. I hope you're all right...It's starting to get colder here; winter is definitely on the way... As Hedwig drops down to skim the treetops we spot Harry approaching Hagrid's Hut. He frowns up at the shuttered windows and dormant chimney.

HARRY:
...In spite of being back at Hogwarts I feel more alone than ever. I know you of all people will understand... A distant WHINNY draws Harry's attention toward the Forbidden Forest...where a THESTRAL rises high above the treetops, soars in a great circle then plunges out of sight. 50	EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEARING - EARLY MORNING	50 Several THESTRALS are gathered around Luna, who is gently petting them. She has a smudge of dirt on her nose. As Harry cautiously approaches she speaks without looking up.

LUNA:
Hello, Harry Potter. Startled, Harry moves to join her. As he shivers in the early morning air he notices her feet are bare.

HARRY:
Your feet--aren't they...cold?

LUNA:
A bit. Unfortunately all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared... (leans in; low:) I suspect Nargles are behind it. Harry nods uncertainly. A BABY THESTRAL approaches; Luna produces an APPLE, gently rolls it toward him. The BABY sniffs it, ignores it.

HARRY:
What are they?

LUNA:
They're called Thestrals. They're quite gentle, really, but most people avoid them because they're a bit...

HARRY:
Different. (Luna nods. A moment) But...why couldn't the others see them?

LUNA:
They can only be seen by people who have seen death.

HARRY:
(murmurs) Cedric... (then) You've known someone who's died, then?

LUNA:
My Mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment. One day one of her spells went rather badly wrong. I was nine.

HARRY:
I'm sorry.

LUNA:
(conversationally) Yes, it was rather horrible. I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But, I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. (off Harry's confusion) That He Who Must Not Be Named is back and you fought him and now (MORE)

LUNA:
the Ministry is conspiring with the Daily Prophet against you and Dumbledore.

HARRY:
Um...Thanks. Seems you're about the only one.

LUNA:
Oh, I don't think that's true... Luna reaches into a bag and produces a piece of RAW MEAT; gently tosses it toward the BABY THESTRAL, who happily catches it in mid-air.

LUNA:
...But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.

HARRY:
What do you mean?

LUNA:
Well if I were You-Know-Who...I'd want you to be cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone... you're not as much of a threat. Harry stares at Luna. The BABY nuzzles her as she looks up at Harry with a radiant smile.

HERMIONE:
Don't you ever stop eating?

RON:
Wha'? Ah'm 'ungry... Suddenly he looks beyond her; swallows:

RON:
Harry. Hermione turns to see a vulnerable, contrite Harry.

HARRY:
All right if I join you? Hermione smiles uncertainly...and then RAISED VOICES are heard outside the hall--

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
...and once brought to my attention I felt it my duty to speak out.

UMBRIDGE:
Speak out? I'm afraid I don't understand... 52	INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY	52 The reunited trio exits the Great Hall to investigate.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Come now, you must admit such behavior is irregular to say the least. Furthermore--

UMBRIDGE:
Pardon me Professor, but what exactly are you insinuating. ?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
I am "insinuating" nothing... McGonagall and Umbridge are on the Marble Stair. McGonagall is clearly uncomfortable with the public nature of the conversation.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
...I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students, you conform to prescribed disciplinary practices... Harry notices Neville among the gathering CROWD; he meets Harry's eye with a look of guilty defiance. As Harry's surprise softens into gratitude, Neville shrugs shyly.

UMBRIDGE:
So silly of me, but it sounds as though you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... (taking a deliberate step up) ...Minerva.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Not at all... (stepping up as well) Dolores. Merely your medieval methods. Umbridge looks at McGonagall with sadness and pity.

UMBRIDGE:
I am sorry dear...but to question my practices is to question the Ministry--and, by extension, the Minister himself. I am a tolerant woman, but the one thing I can't stand for is disloyalty.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Disloyalty--? The trio reacts. Umbridge looks out at the students, as we PUSH IN...

UMBRIDGE:
Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action...

FUDGE:
--Having already revolutionised the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Dolores Umbridge will, as High Inquisitor, now have powers to address the seriously slipping standards at Hogwarts School-- Again we are falling into the pages--WHOOSH--the PAGE TURNS, as we FLY past various other STORIES--"CENTAUR CRISIS CONTINUES," subheaded "Treaty Talks Break Down"-- and ADVERTISEMENTS--"Magical Savings on last years models!"--to FIND a sidebar story: "PARENTS ENDORSE MINISTRY MOVE." A moving PHOTO of LUCIUS MALFOY, sits holding a brandy by the fire in his Wiltshire Mansion, appeals to us with oleaginous sincerity:

LUCIUS MALFOY:
As a parent, I believe the Ministry is doing what's best for all our sakes... (emotionally) For the sake of the children. NOTE: Scenes 46C and 46D [Trelawney and Snape inspections] to be relocated HERE.

HARRY:
Cho--what's going on?

CHO:
It's Professor Trelawney.

TRELAWNEY:
S-Sixteen years I've lived and taught here! H- Hogwarts is m-my h-home! You c-can't do this! REVERSE to reveal Umbridge approaching through a silently parting sea of STUDENTS.

UMBRIDGE:
Actually... (holding up a DECREE) ...I can. Professor McGonagall now hurries to Trelawney, hands her a large handkerchief. Trelawney blows her nose as McGonagall looks daggers at Umbridge.

UMBRIDGE:
Something you'd like to say, dear?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
Oh, there are several things I'd like to say. With a CRACK the oaken front doors swing wide--revealing a dangerously composed Dumbledore. All eyes on him, he approaches Trelawney; murmurs in her ear. She actually

DUMBLEDORE:
Professor McGonagall...might I ask you to escort Sybill back inside?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
(eyeing Umbridge) Happy to.

UMBRIDGE:
Dumbledore: May I remind you that under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, as enacted by the Minister--!

DUMBLEDORE:
--you have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds. That power remains with the Headmaster.

UMBRIDGE:
(pausing) For now. A charged moment between she and Dumbledore--the gloves are off. Dumbledore nods to Professor McGonagall, who takes Trelawney's trembling arm, guides her back inside.

DUMBLEDORE:
I trust you all have studying to do? The CROWD OF STUDENTS quickly break up. In the tumult Harry desperately tries to reach Dumbledore.

HARRY:
Professor? Professor--! But Dumbledore seems not to hear him. Harry has almost caught up as Dumbledore rounds a pillar--and vanishes. FAT DROPS of rain begins to fall as we CRANE UP over Harry: frozen, lost. The WIND RISES; THUNDER BUILDS...

HERMIONE:
That foul, evil old gargoyle! We've got to do something!

RON:
(confused) I thought you hated Trelawney...

HERMIONE:
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, RON! We're not learning how to defend ourselves, we're not learning what we need to pass our OWLS, she's taking over the entire school-- what's Dumbledore playing at?

HARRY:
(murmurs) I wish I knew... The WIZARD'S WIRELESS on the side table CRACKLES to life.

ANNOUNCER:
At the witching hour, here are the latest headlines...Cornelius Fudge today denied rumors that the mysterious disappearance of several Ministry workers is related to last year's appearance of the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup... Ron starts to say something but Hermione immediately SHUSHES him. Ron just sighs, shakes his head as she hurries to turn up the volume, and he and Harry join her.

ANNOUNCER:
...With increased incidents of Goblin unrest as well as rumblings among the Giants, the Minister sought to quell the qualms of the wizard world:

FUDGE:
We wish to assure the public that Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority. Furthermore, we have convincing evidence these disappearances are the work of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. Make no mistake: we will hunt him down and find him wherever he hides...

SIRIUS:
Come and get me, Fudgey... SIRIUS' HEAD appears in the fire's dancing flames. As his face eerily BURNS and REFORMS the trio rush to kneel on the hearthrug.

HARRY:
Sirius! What are you doing here?

SIRIUS:
Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing, training you all to kill half breeds?

HARRY:
Half-breeds? What are you talking about?

HERMIONE:
I've been reading up on her-- Umbridge loathes part-humans of any kind. At the Ministry she was infamous for it--anti-werewolf legislation, imposing territorial restrictions on Centaurs...

HARRY:
Sirius, she's not letting us use magic at all.

SIRIUS:
I might have guessed. Latest intelligence is Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.

RON:
Combat? What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army?

SIRIUS:
That's exactly what he thinks-- that Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He's getting more paranoid by the minute... The gravity of this sinks in. Sirius hesitates.

SIRIUS:
The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry ...but things aren't going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...and these "disappearances" are just how it started last time. Voldemort is on the move.

HARRY:
What can we do, Sirius?

SIRIUS:
I'm not sure...I do know your Dad never would have lain down for the likes of Umbridge. (MORE)

SIRIUS:
(Harry takes this in) Someone's coming. Sorry I can't be more help, but for now at least... (grimaces, concerned) ...looks like you're on your own. His face turns to ASH and vanishes. THUNDER CRACKS; LIGHTNING FLASHES. Hermione goes to the window, shivers.

HERMIONE:
He really is out there, isn't he. Harry and Ron join her. The trio look out at the increasingly violent storm.

HERMIONE:
We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how... (turning to Harry) We need someone who will. Ron looks up in dawning comprehension. They both look at Harry--LIGHTNING FLASHES-- 60	REVERSE	60 We PULL BACK THROUGH the window as Ron and Hermione fall on Harry, talking with greater and greater animation--as Harry looks more and more dubious. THUNDER CRACKS as SHEETS OF RAIN obscure the castle from view... ...and now as the wind spirals us wildly upward, LIGHTNING suddenly illuminates a towering CLOUD FORMATION that looks eerily like Voldemort's head. The WIND HOWLS...and BECOMES THE WHISPERS FROM HARRY'S DREAMS as we are propelled TOWARD it, THROUGH its gaping MOUTH... As the rain CRYSTALLIZES into SNOW and night BRIGHTENS into day, the wind bears us toward Hogsmeade Village...

HARRY:
This is mad. Who'd want to be taught by me? I'm a nutter, remember?

RON:
Look on the bright side--you can't be any worse than old toad-face.

HARRY:
(stares, then) Thanks, Ron.

RON:
I'm here for you, mate. 62	INT. HOG'S HEAD INN - DAY	62 A mounted BOAR'S HEAD turns as the door CREAKS open. The trio peers into the dingy room, lit by stubby candles on rough wooden tables. Ron sniffs at the sour air.

RON:
Lovely spot.

HERMIONE:
I thought it'd be safer someplace off the beaten track. The BARMAN (ABERFORTH DUMBLEDORE) peers goatishly at them as he wipes glasses with a filthy rag.

HARRY:
Who's supposed to be meeting us?

HERMIONE:
Oh, just a couple of people... (looks around the deserted pub) I'm sure they'll be here soon. Harry frowns...and then Hermione brightens as the door opens and a crowd of STUDENTS hurries in: Neville, Ginny, Fred and George, Cho, Luna, the young second-year Nigel, PARVATI and PADMA PATIL, a SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY, a SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY, and a dozen OTHERS stand looking around the gloom.

HARRY:
A couple of people? Hermione smiles weakly. As the group gathers there is uneasiness on both sides; some of the students have openly challenging expressions; others are more curious. Harry spots Cho's uncertain smile; flushes.

HERMIONE:
Um--hi. So, you all know why we're here. We need a teacher--a proper teacher, one who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts--

SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY:
Why?

RON:
Why? Because You-Know-Who is back, you tosspot!

SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY:
(a nod at Harry) So he says.

HERMIONE:
So Dumbledore says--

SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY:
So Dumbledore said because he says. The point is, where's the proof?

SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY:
If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed... Cho stands perfectly still, refusing to cry.

HARRY:
I'm not going to talk about Cedric. So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out now. A flash of gratitude from Cho; Harry turns to Hermione:

HARRY:
Let's go. They're just here because they think I'm some sort of freak--

HERMIONE:
(desperate) Harry, wait--

LUNA:
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm? The crowd grows quiet. Harry spots Luna standing in the back. Hermione seizes the opening.

HERMIONE:
Yes. I've seen it. A fully-formed stag Patronus.

DEAN THOMAS:
Blimey Harry! I never knew that!

NEVILLE:
He--he also killed a Basilisk-- with the sword in Dumbledore's office!

GINNY:
It's true. The crowd is impressed. The tide is beginning to turn.

RON:
And third year he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once--

HERMIONE:
And last year he did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh--

HARRY:
Wait. All eyes swing to Harry. He is struggling mightily with this. Finally, speaking to both his friends and the group:

HARRY:
Look--it all sounds great when you say it like that. But the truth is, a lot of it was luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I nearly always had help--

HERMIONE:
(quickly) He's just being modest.

HARRY:
No, Hermione. I'm not. (to the group) Facing this stuff in real life...it isn't like school at all. In school, if you make a mistake you can just...try again tomorrow. But out there... (haunted) ...when you're a second away from being murdered...or watching a friend die right before your eyes... He falters as his eyes fall on Cho, her eyes brimming.

HARRY:
You just...you don't know what it's like. The group is silent. Hermione looks at Harry; chastened.

HERMIONE:
You're right Harry. We don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're to have any chance of beating V-Voldemort... It's the first time she's said his name. Harry looks at her, then the group. Young Nigel, scared, looks up at Harry. In a small voice:

NIGEL:
He really is back?

HARRY:
We're the young ones now. SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY hesitates...then silently steps forward...and nods--"I'm in." Harry's eyes fall on Nigel, gazing at him almost worshipfully--and the responsibility of what he's taking on sinks in. One by one the OTHERS step forward; Ron and Hermione exchange shivery glances--there is an air of destiny about the moment. The SUN breaks through clouds, brightening even the pub's grimy windows...as the BARMAN winces grumpily... INSERT: A PIECE OF PARCHMENT with the words DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY written in bold letters across the top. One by one one the students sign their names.

HARRY:
...all right--next thing is to find a place to practice where Umbridge won't find out-- 63	EXT. BRIDGE/CLOCKTOWER BRIDGE - DAY	63 We SOAR toward the bridge. FIND the trio, flanked by Ginny and Neville. They walk purposefully toward us, their excitement palpable.

GINNY:
The Shrieking Shack?

HARRY:
Too small.

HERMIONE:
The Forbidden Forest?

RON:
Not bloody likely.

GINNY:
Harry...What happens if Umbridge does find out?

HERMIONE:
(a bit giddy) Oh, who cares. I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it? Breaking the rules?

RON:
Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?

HERMIONE:
(flushes) Anyway...we know at least one positive thing came from today.

HARRY:
What's that?

HERMIONE:
(grinning) Cho just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she... Harry turns pink as Ron beams, slaps him on the back. Ginny, however, doesn't seem quite as pleased...

HARRY:
Okay: in the next few days each of us comes up with a couple of possibilities for places to practice... As the others nod we MOVE IN ON Neville, his brow creased in concentration...

DRACO MALFOY:
Watch where you're going, Longbottom... Draco sneers, moves on, as Neville hurries around the corner... As he walks past a blank section of wall he abruptly halts. Slowly turns, goes back...and now where the plain stone wall was, a HIGHLY FILIGREED DOOR has appeared. Neville hesitates, opens it...

HERMIONE:
You've done it, Neville! You've found the Room of Requirement!

RON:
The which?

HERMIONE:
I've heard rumors about it for ages but I never believed them until now. ! (seeing their confusion) It's also known as the Come and Go room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it, and is always equipped for the seekers' needs.

RON:
So, say you really needed a toilet. ?

HERMIONE:
Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's the general idea.

HARRY:
It's brilliant. Like Hogwarts wants us to fight back... Suddenly a glint of silver falls past Harry's face. Harry smiles in amazement as he bends down and picks up a shiny WHISTLE...holds it to his lips--BLOWS--

HARRY:
All right...so...I was thinking the first thing we should practice is disarming charms...

SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY:
Isn't that sort of. basic?

HARRY:
It saved my life last year. An impressed MURMUR. Ron and Hermione exchange a happy look...Harry exhales--he's begun.

A DEATH EATER:
towers above us, its hideous skull-like MASK grinning. PULL BACK to reveal it is a quite realistic-looking DUMMY, its arms extended, one hand holding a prodigious bone WAND. Uneasy STUDENTS stand in a line before it--Neville first. He stares up at the Death Eater--takes a deep breath--

NEVILLE:
Expelliarmus! Neville's wand goes spinning out of his hand in a SHOWER OF SPARKS--STUDENTS DUCK as it SHOOTS over their heads and smashes against the wall. Harry frowns--this is going to be harder than he thought. Neville sags in despair.

NEVILLE:
I'm hopeless. Harry hesitates--then, with determination:

HARRY:
No you're not. You're just flourishing your wand too much. Here, try it like this-- Harry demonstrates with a sharp flick of his wrist...as just beyond, Hermione and Ginny exchange an impressed smile...

UMBRIDGE:
...you will please copy the approved text four times--

UMBRIDGE:
--to ensure maximum retention. (the class GROANS) There will be no need to talk. As Umbridge passes Hermione she grips her pencil in frustration, mutters:

HERMIONE:
No need to think's more like it. Umbridge stops--glares at her imperiously--then her eyes widen in fury as she spots Neville intently practicing the same wrist flick motion beyond.

UMBRIDGE:
Wands away! Neville nearly jumps out of his chair--Umbridge glowers ...then her eyes fall on Harry. She is disarmed to find

HARRY:
Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal...

HARRY:
....it's sort of a wizard's bread and butter, really... Students LAUGH appreciatively; as Harry turns we see who he's squared off against--a very nervous Nigel. Harry smiles encouragingly:

HARRY:
It's all right, Nigel. Take your best shot. Nigel takes a deep breath, then--

NIGEL:
STUPEFY! A JET of RED LIGHT leaps from Nigel's wand--sending Harry FLYING twenty feet through the air! But Nigel goes sprawling too--not used to the KICKBACK from his wand. Fortunately the stone floor DEFORMS into PILLOWY SHAPES, cushioning Nigel's landing completely. Harry and an awed Nigel blink at each other from across the floor--Harry grins.

HARRY:
Not bad. Next-- A LITTLE LATER. Ron and Hermione are up; they step forward together, both feeling a bit awkward. BOYS and GIRLS silently gravitate towards their respective champion--Ginny and Luna silently rooting for Hermione, Dean and Neville for Ron--who confides quietly to Hermione:

RON:
Don't worry--I'll go easy on you.

HERMIONE:
(playing along) Oh, thank you, Ronald. They take their positions--both take a deep breath-- HERMIONE/RON STUPEFY! Hermione's wand emits a JET of RED LIGHT--sending Ron soaring through the air and slamming--OOF--against the mirror wall. He stares up at a slightly abashed Hermione,

RON:
I--I let her do that. I mean it's just good manners, isn't it! (the BOYS turn away, GRUMBLING) It was completely intentional--I'm telling you--! He turns helplessly to a grinning Harry-- OMITTED

THRU	THRU:

HARRY:
Good...keep your concentration... REVERSE to show their victims--the YOUNGER STUDENTS, floating in mid-air. Harry walks alongside, gently adjusting positions, wand angles.

HARRY:
Little higher there...nice. He reaches Cho, struggling to hold up Nigel, his eyes pleading not to drop him. Harry gingerly puts his arms around her to adjust her wand angle; as they touch, both SHIVER, BLUSH--and Nigel tumbles wildly out frame. Fred and George exchange a knowing grin... ...and as our view passes the WINDOWS reflected in the MIRROR WALL, DAYLIGHT magically fades to NIGHT--

HARRY:
Working hard is important...but there's something that matters even more: believing in yourself...

HARRY:
Think of it this way... As Harry passes each student they look to him, eager for approval--he nods warmly.

HARRY:
...every great wizard in history started out as nothing more than what we are now--students. If they could do it...why not you? Harry turns to survey the room--STUDENTS FLOATING in the AIR, being KNOCKED OFF THEIR FEET, FROZEN. The joy of learning is palpable. Harry takes it all in, exhilarated.

UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT - INTERCUT	74 CANDLES FLICKER as we TRACK PAST Crabbe, Goyle, PANSY PARKINSON, and the plus-sized WARRINGTON, each with a handsome silver "I" PIN on their lapels. Umbridge pins the last one on a smirking Draco. OFF Umbridge, demonic in the candlelight--

NEVILLE:
Expelliarmus!

NEVILLE:
I--I did it. Harry beams at his friend with pride as EVERYONE comes up to congratulate Neville, pound his back... CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS glint in the blue magic-hour light. Harry turns to catch the eye of Nigel, standing near the door with the MARAUDER'S MAP. He gives Harry a thumbs up.

HARRY:
(blows his WHISTLE) All right, that's it for this time. Now we won't be meeting again until after the holiday... (a disappointed GROAN) ...so keep working on your own as best you can. But good work, everyone--really. A spontaneous round of APPLAUSE as Harry turns pink; Hermione and Ron beam. As class breaks up STUDENTS wish Harry "Happy Christmas." The room begins to clear as Harry collects the cushions. He pauses as he spots Cho standing alone by the class NOTICE BOARD. He takes a deep breath, starts toward her-- but is intercepted by Fred and George, each with an armful of bright orange SKIVING SNACKBOXES.

FRED:
We've been thinking, Harry--we could slip Umbridge some puking Pastilles with her tea.

GEORGE:
Or Fever Fudge--they give you these massive pus-filled boils right on your--

HARRY:
Sounds good guys...would you excuse me? They glance at Cho; grin. Harry flushes...then approaches a tearful Cho.

HARRY:
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day...

CHO:
I'm okay. Anyway it's worth it... Her gaze rises to the NOTICE BOARD; on it is the PARCHMENT with the list of D.A. members, the PHOTO of the old Order, Prophet articles with ominous headlines...and a large photo of CEDRIC DIGGORY in a

CHO:
It's just...learning all this...it makes me wonder whether if he'd known it...

HARRY:
Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just Voldemort was better.

CHO:
You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to Stun anything before... Cho looks into Harry's eyes. The moment is palpable...and as Cho silently glances up, we SWEEP UP TO REVEAL the MISTLETOE hanging over their heads.

CHO:
Mistletoe.

HARRY:
(swallows hard) Yeah....probably full of Nargles though.

CHO:
What are Nargles?

HARRY:
No idea. And with that they both find themselves leaning in...Time slows, the HEAVENS SPIN as they KISS--

RON:
Well? How was it?

HARRY:
Wet. (clarifying) I mean she was sort of...crying.

RON:
(winces sympathetically) That bad at it, are you?

HERMIONE:
I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days.

RON:
You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.

HERMIONE:
(incredulous) Don't you understand how she must be feeling? Harry and Ron share a bewildered look, shake their heads.

HERMIONE:
Well obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him. Also she's conflicted because Umbridge is threatening to have her Mum sacked from her job at the Ministry, as well as frightened of failing her OWLs because she's so busy worrying about everything else.

RON:
One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode!

HERMIONE:
Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... Harry grins as Ron makes a face at Hermione...but as Harry looks into the FIRE his smile fades...the crackling FLAMES WHISPER as they FLARE, CONSUMING us--

DUMBLEDORE:
...in the dream, were you standing beside the victim, or looking down on the scene? Harry glances over at Ron--now joined by a subdued George, Fred and a frightened Ginny, all in their dressing gowns. Harry hesitates.

HARRY:
Neither. It was like I...I... Dumbledore closes his eyes in pained comprehension.

HARRY:
Professor...please...just tell me-- Harry moves into his eyeline but Dumbledore subtly counters, turning toward

DUMBLEDORE:
Everard. A sallow-faced PORTRAIT WIZARD opens his eyes.

DUMBLEDORE:
Arthur was on Guard Duty tonight... (HARRY reacts) Make sure he is found by the right people.

HARRY:
(desperately) Sir--? Harry again approaches. Though it clearly pains him to do so, Dumbledore again turns away from Harry, towards

DUMBLEDORE:
Phineas: I need you to go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife and children will be arriving shortly by portkey. PHINEAS nods, exits--once more Harry tries to catch Dumbledore's eye--just as Everard returns, out of breath--

EVERARD:
They've got him, Albus. It was close but they think he'll make it; they're taking him to St. Mungo's now.

DUMBLEDORE:
(deeply relieved) Thank heavens. Now. Next we must--

HARRY:
(erupting) LOOK AT ME! Silence! Dumbledore's blue eyes lock onto Harry in surprise--and fear. For an instant Harry's eyes are ablaze with rage--though whether his own or Voldemort's isn't immediately clear. Harry falters; suddenly bewildered, terrified.

HARRY:
What's happening to me...? Dumbledore turns away, anguished...as SNAPE appears in the doorway.

SNAPE:
You wished to see me, Headmaster?

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes, Severus. I'm afraid we daren't wait even until morning.

SNAPE:
Occlumency: the art of magical mind defense...

SNAPE:
It would appear there is a connection between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is yet aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear. Pray he remains ignorant.

HARRY:
You mean if he knows...he'll be able to read my mind?

SNAPE:
Read it. Control it. Unhinge it... In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony-- only when he had them literally begging for death--would he finally kill them. (approaching) Used properly the power of Occlumency will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself. (raising his wand) LEGILIMENS! Harry squeezes shut his eyes--

KREACHER:
Nasty brat, standing there bold as brass... Harry turns in surprise to find KREACHER, lovingly polishing a MUTTERING curtained PORTRAIT. The old Elf's eyes widen; he HISSES:

KREACHER:
Harry Potter...the boy who stopped the Dark Lord. Friend to mudbloods and blood-traitors alike...if my poor Mistress only knew... Kreacher spits at Harry's feet--

SIRIUS:
KREACHER! (Kreacher whirls to find Sirius in the doorway) Enough of your bile. Leave us.

KREACHER:
Of course, Master. Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black... He bows out, MUTTERING all the way. Sirius grimaces.

SIRIUS:
Sorry about that. He was never very pleasant, even when I was a boy. Well, not to me anyway...

HARRY:
Wait a second--you grew up here?

SIRIUS:
It was my parents house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. About the only useful thing I've been able to do. He moves to the tapestry; regards it.

SIRIUS:
I hated the lot of them; my parents with their pure-blood mania... We notice the MOVING IMAGE of a wild-eyed WITCH, her face literally UNRAVELING--BELLATRIX LESTRANGE. Nearby, next to REGULUS BLACK, Harry finds Sirius' name--but instead of a portrait there is only a SCORCHED HOLE.

SIRIUS:
My Mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman. I was sixteen.

HARRY:
Where did you go?

SIRIUS:
Your Dad's. I was always welcome at the Potter's... I see him so much in you, Harry. You're so very much alike...

HARRY:
I'm not so sure. (hesitates) Sirius...When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching. I was the snake. And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...for a moment I wanted to...I wanted... He can't say it. Anguished:

HARRY:
This connection between me and Voldemort--what if the reason for it is because...is because I'm becoming more like him? (helplessly) I just feel so angry all the time now...What if, after everything I've been through, something's... (his darkest fear) ....gone wrong inside me? What if I"m becoming...bad? Sirius looks deeply into his Godson's eyes.

SIRIUS:
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You are not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. Do you understand? (Harry, welling, nods) Besides...the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. Harry looks up at Sirius, deeply grateful. And then Hermione appears in the doorway.

HERMIONE:
Harry? Time to go. Harry nods. Turns to Sirius.

HARRY:
Seems like we're always saying goodbye.

SIRIUS:
It won't always be this way. When all this is over we'll be a proper family. You'll see. As Sirius and Harry hug, we MOVE PAST them toward the tapestry. We PUSH IN on the SCORCHED HOLE above Sirius' name--FLY THROUGH IT--

UMBRIDGE:
...I will say this one last time. As High Inquisitor and the Ministry's representative I am ordering you to tell me where you've been!

HAGRID:
I told yer--I've been away for me health. As he speaks he turns toward the window--revealing his horribly bruised face. Hermione GASPS. Hagrid gives her a warning look. Umbridge leans to look around his massive form but the trio has ducked out of sight--just.

UMBRIDGE:
Your health.

HAGRID:
Bit o' fresh air, yeh know.

UMBRIDGE:
Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be difficult to come by. (pausing) You should know "Professor," the Ministry is most determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers-- particularly those less...lucky	in their lineage. You are half giant, are you not? Hagrid stiffens. Hermione stares, her blood boiling. Ron warns her with a stern but sympathetic look.

HAGRID:
I don't see what that has to do with my ability to teach.

UMBRIDGE:
No...You wouldn't. (pausing at the door) If I were you I shouldn't get too used to being back. In fact. I mightn't bother unpacking at all.

HERMIONE:
Oh Hagrid, what happened?

HAGRID:
I told yer, it's nothin'. Want a cuppa?

RON:
Nothing? Would you say that if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face? Hagrid grimaces, limps over to his chair, winces as he clutches his ribs. As he settles back in his chair he slaps a green dragon steak over his eye...which his tail- wagging BOARHOUND FANG locks his eyes on.

HARRY:
Hagrid...it's us. Hagrid hesitates--looks around warily--then leans in, low:

HAGRID:
Now this is all top secret, mind yeh...but Dumbledore sent me ter parley with the Giants.

HERMIONE:
Giants! (Hagrid shushes her nervously; whispers:) You found them?

HAGRID:
They're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest. Pretty big, see. Live deep in the mountains... Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was...Like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'...

HARRY:
And they did this to you?

HAGRID:
(hesitates) Not exactly...I mean, in a manner o' speakin'... (finally sighs) Long story. The trio exchange confused looks...

HAGRID:
Anyhow I tried to convince 'em ter join the cause--but I wasn't the only one trying to win 'em over...

RON:
Death Eaters?

HAGRID:
(nods; grimly:) Tryin' to persuade 'em to join You-Know-Who.

HARRY:
And...? Did they?

HAGRID:
Don' know. I gave 'em Dumbledore's message; I 'spect some o' them'll remember he's friendly to 'em...I 'spect. Oh all right yeh can have it, yeh dozy dog... Fang, who has been WHIMPERING plaintively, now leaps up as Hagrid tosses him the steak, attacks it with relish. Hagrid rises, goes to the window. Subdued:

HAGRID:
It's changin' out there. Jus' like last time... (turns) The storm's comin', Harry. And we all best be ready when she does.

WHOOSH--the PAGE TURNS to reveal a MOVING PHOTO of FUDGE--fear in his eyes--now retreating through the Atrium as he dodges a throng of REPORTERS.

FUDGE:
We strongly suspect this breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience escaping Azkaban: notorious mass-murderer Sirius Black, cousin to escapee Bellatrix Lestrange... We rapidly PULL OUT-- 98	INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING	98 --to find Neville reading the article during breakfast. He looks up, his gaze hard, distant. FIND the trio just

HERMIONE:
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. He's going to get us all killed, just because he's too scared to face the truth.

SEAMUS:
Harry? Harry turns in surprise to find a nervous Seamus.

SEAMUS:
I wanted to apologize. Now even me Mam says the Prophet's version of things don't add up. What I'm trying to say is...I believe you.

NEVILLE:
Fourteen years ago...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information, but they never gave in. They've been...like you saw...ever since. Harry doesn't know what to say. Neville turns to him.

NEVILLE:
I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet. Harry nods...then puts a hand on Neville's shoulder.

HARRY:
We're going to make them proud, Neville. That's a promise. They both look up at the photo...both sets of parents smiling down at their sons.

HARRY:
Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. Allow it to fill you up... He passes the newest DA Member--SEAMUS--straining as a WISP OF VAPOR comes out of his wand...

HARRY:
Keep trying, Seamus... (moving on) A corporeal Patronus is the most difficult to produce, but shield forms can also be extremely useful against a variety of opponents... He passes Hermione, rigid with concentration. Suddenly an OTTER PATRONUS BLOOMS from her wand, gambols around her, to her delight. Harry nods his approval.

HARRY:
Now remember: Your Patronus can only protect you as long as you stay focused... He passes Luna, peering vaguely down the end of her wand.

HARRY:
Focus, Luna. Luna sighs as Harry moves on...passes Neville, his face shining with sweat. But only feeble wisps of vapor issue from his wand tip.

HARRY:
Think of the happiest thing you can, Neville.

NEVILLE:
(holding his breath) I'm--trying-- Finally he exhales. Determined, instantly tries again-- Harry approaches Ginny, straining-- suddenly LIGHT erupts out of her wand; she stares in amazement at the SILVERY VEIL above her. Harry smiles with pride as he turns to take in the class, mostly VAPOR and SHIELDS--but here and there an animal form--a BADGER erupts from Somewhat Doubtful Boy's wand...a DOG forms in front of an amazed Ron--

NIGEL:
Harry! Nigel urgently motions Harry to join him by the door.

HARRY:
Who've we got this time?

NIGEL:
All of them I think. INSERT: On the MARAUDER'S MAP we see the names UMBRIDGE, FILCH, MALFOY--and a DOZEN OTHERS--floating just on the other side of the wall. Harry frowns.

HARRY:
That's funny. How would they know we're here now...? He turns to see Cho's usual spot is empty. Suddenly a BOOMING THUD makes the entire door wall vibrate. DUST trickles down from above. Shields begin to EVAPORATE as the class looks over in confusion. Another THUD; more DUST falls as the stones GROAN in protest. THUD--MORTAR flies--Harry throws himself in front of Nigel as a thin beam of LIGHT stabs the dusty air. Harry cautiously peers through the chink...to see Filch, sledgehammer in hand; Umbridge beside him.

UMBRIDGE:
Stand aside, Argus. I'll make short work of this. She AIMS HER WAND directly at us. Harry's eyes go wide--

HARRY:
GET DOWN!

UMBRIDGE:
BOMBARDA MAXIMA! A GLITTERING EXPLOSION rocks the room as students dive for cover. Choking on dust, Harry pulls himself to his feet...to see a huge, ragged HOLE has taken out half the wall, its raw edges sparkling with residual MAGICAL ENERGY. The ROOM ITSELF seems to GROAN IN PAIN as shadows appear through colored smoke--

HARRY:
RUN!

UMBRIDGE:
GET THEM!

UMBRIDGE:
Dumbledore's Army--proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius! Fudge, Shacklebolt, and DAWLISH--a tough-looking wizard with short wiry hair--surround Dumbledore. Percy Weasley takes notes. Harry stares at Cho, seated, near tears. Cho looks up at him pleadingly...but finally Harry is unable to look at her, and turns away. Cho wells up... Umbridge hands the DA Parchment to a stunned Fudge as she sneers at Dumbledore:

UMBRIDGE:
All your fearmongering about You- Know-Who never fooled us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were--a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry!

DUMBLEDORE:
Naturally. Harry's eyes widen as he realizes what Dumbledore's doing.

HARRY:
Professor--no--! (desperately turns to Umbridge) He knew nothing about this! It was me--!

DUMBLEDORE:
(overriding him) Most noble of you, Harry, to try and shield me, but as has been pointed out, the Parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army"--not "Potter's." (turns to Fudge) I instructed Harry to form this organization--and I alone am responsible for its activities. Fudge blinks at Dumbledore, slightly stunned...as Dumbledore looks reassuringly at Harry.

FUDGE:
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet; if we hurry we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt: You will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban to await trial for conspiracy and sedition--

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah, I thought we might hit that little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to--what is the phrase? 'Come quietly.' But I'm afraid I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

UMBRIDGE:
Enough of this rubbish. TAKE HIM. As they raise their wands Dumbledore smiles a warm, encouraging smile at Harry--who looks helplessly back-- And then a STREAK OF SILVER LIGHT flashes as FAWKES swoops low overhead. Harry watches in astonishment as Dumbledore WHIRLS--A CONCUSSIVE BLAST OF LIGHT sends Fudge and Umbridge sprawling as Dumbledore reaches up to grab the Phoenix' tail--and in a BLAZE OF FIRE both bird and Headmaster are gone. As Fudge and Umbridge sit up, stunned, Shacklebolt smiles a private smile.

SHACKLEBOLT:
You may not like him, Minister... but you can't deny Dumbledore's got style.

SERIES OF SHOTS:
TUMBLERS fall and CYLINDERS rotate as the CLOCK TOWER DOOR SLAMS SHUT. We CORKSCREW down and through the Marble Stair. Most of the PORTRAITS have been removed. Near the bottom FILCH is taking down one of the last protesting PORTRAITS; as he sets it on its side the OCCUPANTS of the GROUP

Harry... Harry hesitates...then finally turns away, unable to look at her. As he walks away Cho stares after him, tears welling...then turns and runs.

RON:
...you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.

HERMIONE:
He's right. Not even Dumbledore saw this coming. Besides, if it's anyone's fault it's ours...

RON:
Yeah, we talked you into it.

HARRY:
But I agreed. (struggling) I tried so hard to help--but all I've done is make things worse. (quietly) Anyway. It doesn't matter now... Ron and Hermione look at him, confused...then, intensely:

HARRY:
...because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. And the more you care...the more you have to lose. (his darkest moment) Maybe it is better just to...

HERMIONE:
What?

HARRY:
Go it alone. Ron and Hermione share a worried look as Harry turns away, starts down the bridge--but is stopped by the sight of Hagrid peering in from the forest end of the bridge--his face scratched and bruised; his eyes red from crying.

HARRY:
Hagrid...?

RON:
Any idea where he's taking us? Hermione shakes her head. Harry approaches Hagrid.

HARRY:
Hagrid? Please, can't you just tell us-- Hagrid tries to reply, but--too upset to speak--finally just shakes his head woefully and continues on. Ron looks after him with quiet awe:

RON:
He's lost his mind.

HERMIONE:
What is that?

RON:
Whatever it is...it's not a happy sound. Suddenly Hagrid scoops up all three of them, DIVES off the path--just as a deafening BLUR OF HOOVES THUNDER BY. As the trio peers up through the roots we catch glimpses of HUMAN TORSOS and fierce, war-painted faces. As the herd of CENTAURS finally passes Hagrid and the trio rise, look after them.

HAGRID:
Never seen the Centaurs so riled-- an' they're dangerous at the bes' of times. Ministry restricts their territory much more, they're gonna have a real uprisin' on their hands--or worse.

HERMIONE:
(gently) Hagrid...? What's going on? Hagrid takes out his huge spotted handkerchief, blows his nose, wipes his tear-filled eyes.

HAGRID:
Sorry t'be so mysterious you three. I wouldn' be botherin' yer with this at all--but with Dumbledore gone I'll likely be gettin' the sack any day now, an' I can' leave withou' tellin' someone abou' him...

HARRY:
About...who?

HAGRID:
Go easy now...he can be a bit... high-spirited. They creep forward, emerge into a clearing with a small HILL in the center. A low, rhythmic RUMBLING is audible.

RON:
Harry...that hill. It's breathing. As the "hill" shifts in its sleep several BIRDS light into the air. Hagrid cautiously approaches the slumbering GIANT.

HERMIONE:
Oh Hagrid...you didn't.

HAGRID:
I had ter bring 'im back! The other giants were all bullyin' him, 'cause he's so small!

HERMIONE:
Small? (and once more) Small?

HAGRID:
I couldn' jus' leave 'im! See-- he's my brother.

RON:
Blimey.

HAGRID:
Well--half-brother. Turns out after me mother left me dad she took up with this other giant, see--well actually, she knew him before she left, but it wasn't 'til after that she went an had-- (sighs) Long story. GRAWP STIRS, sniffing at Hagrid...cautiously opens a sleepy eye.

HAGRID:
Had a nice sleep, did yeh Grawpy? Grawp YAWNS hugely, stretches, and rises to his full sixteen-foot height. He peers in fascination at the circling BIRDS...

HAGRID:
Grawp! Down here, yeh big buffoon! Ignoring him, Grawp playfully reaches for one of the BIRDS--catches it--SPLAT. He frowns in confusion...tears well...and then abruptly licks his hand. BELCHES.

HAGRID:
Come on now Grawpy! I brought yeh some company!

HARRY:
Hagrid...is this how you got all your injuries? As Hagrid climbs to his feet he flushes, embarrassed:

HAGRID:
Oh, no no no no...well, yes. But he's a good boy, really--jes don' know his own strength is all.... Grawp bends down; Harry and Ron don't much interest him, but Hermione is another matter. He sniffs...smiles a shy broken-toothed smile...and with a swift movement grabs her and lifts her into the air. Hermione SCREAMS.

HAGRID:
GRAWPY! THA'S NOT POLITE! Hermione is rigid as Grawp deeply breathes in her hair, sighs happily.

RON:
HAGRID, DO SOMETHING!

HAGRID:
(sternly, clears his throat) BAD BOY, GRAWPY! I tol' yeh, we don' grab--! Tha's yer new friend Hermione! Ron finds a stick and starts furiously beating Grawp's shins as Hagrid desperately tries to save the situation.

HAGRID:
Don' you worry now, he's completely harmless--! PUT HER DOWN YEH BIG OAF! Like I said, jes a bit high- spirited is all--GRAWPY--! Suddenly Grawp kicks Ron, sending him sprawling into a tree--hard. Ron winces in pain. Hagrid grimaces. Hermione turns instantly to Grawp, fixes him a furious stare.

HERMIONE:
Grawp. GRAWP. Listen. Carefully: Put. Me. DOWN. (Grawp hesitates) NOW. Her tone defies the possibility of argument.

RON:
Are you all right?

HERMIONE:
Just needs a firm hand is all.

HARRY:
I think you've got an admirer... Grawp is biting his finger, gazing down at Hermione with inordinate fondness. Ron glares jealously up at him.

RON:
You just stay away from her. Chastened, Grawp turns to where he's stored a collection of precious items under a tree root. He picks out a bicycle handlebar with a bell, shyly presents it to Hermione, who blushes.

HAGRID:
He can get his own food an' all... it's company he'll need--after I'm gone. (to Harry) Yeh will look after him, won't yer? I'm the only family he's got. Harry looks helplessly up at Grawp...and nods. A BIRD CRIES; wheels through the dusky, star-strewn sky. Grawp looks up, follows it wistfully with his eyes, as if envying its freedom...DISSOLVE TO:

SNAPE:
Feeling sentimental...? Suddenly the IMAGE SWIMS, RUSHES TOWARD US--WHOOSH--

HARRY:
That's--private.

SNAPE:
Not to me--and not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve! Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you! You won't last two seconds once he invades your mind! (sneers) You're just like your father. Lazy. Arrogant.

HARRY:
Don't you say a word against my--

SNAPE:
Weak.

HARRY:
I'm. Not. Weak.

SNAPE:
Then prove it. Control your emotions, discipline your mind! Legilimens--! A FLASH OF RED--again the OFFICE SWIMS--

FLASH CUTS:
A FLURRY of blurred IMAGES RUSH TOWARD US as we're PLUNGED through HARRY'S MIND--Harry under the sorting hat--Harry and Cedric running through the Maze...

SNAPE:
Concentrate, Potter. FOCUS-- The IMAGE SWIMS, FALLS AWAY--we're SPUN UP THROUGH

SIRIUS:
...but know this: the ones who love us never really leave us. You can always find them (MORE)

SIRIUS:
(he taps Harry's chest) In here. Younger Harry smiles...as we CIRCLE to reveal SNAPE.

SNAPE:
I may vomit.

HARRY:
STOP IT--!

SNAPE:
Is this what you call control? Harry stares--and falters. He looks exhausted.

HARRY:
We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest--

SNAPE:
The Dark Lord isn't resting! (approaching) You and Black are two of a kind: sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well perhaps it's escaped your notice but life isn't fair. Your "blessed" father knew that, in fact he frequently saw to it--

HARRY:
My father was a great man!

SNAPE:
YOUR FATHER WAS A SWINE-- Snape PUSHES Harry's chest, sending him crashing into a wall of jars. Fury burns in Harry's eyes. He raises his wand--Snape extends his own--

SNAPE:
LEGILIMENS!

YOUNG JAMES:
Expelliarmus! Young Snape's wand flies out of his reach. As he dives to retrieve it--

YOUNG JAMES:
Impedimenta! Snape goes sprawling--and FREEZES IN MID-AIR...as now we REVEAL HARRY, watching in mute horror.

HARRY:
Dad...? Suddenly the memory SWIMS, JUMP CUTS--Harry remains constant but the scene shifts around him to moments later--a CROWD has gathered. YOUNG SIRIUS, YOUNG LUPIN, and YOUNG WORMTAIL back up James as he effortlessly rotates Young Snape in the air. Young Sirius exchanges an uneasy look with Young Lupin, as a pretty GIRL with red hair pushes through the crowd.

YOUNG LILY:
Leave him alone!

YOUNG JAMES:
Well well, the indomitable Miss Evans...

YOUNG SNAPE:
(humiliated) I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, MUDBLOOD-- Lily reacts as if slapped--she and Young Snape lock eyes. James angrily brandishes his wand--SCOURGIFY!--and SOAP BUBBLES froth from Snape's mouth, gagging him.

YOUNG JAMES:
He makes it easy to hate him... doesn't he. A shaken Lily looks up at James.

YOUNG LILY:
That's the thing, isn't it. Hate is always easy. It's the other bit that's hard. But you wouldn't understand that--would you. James' assurance falters. He watches her vanish into the crowd...then turns to the crowd with false cheer:

YOUNG JAMES:
Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?

SNAPE:
ENOUGH--!!! Harry looks up to see adult Snape, white with rage--THE SCENE DISSOLVES BEHIND HIM--

SNAPE:
Your lessons are at an end.

SNAPE:
Get. Out. Terrified, Harry bolts--

FRED:
(quietly) You know George...I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.

GEORGE:
Fred: I've been thinking the same thing myself.

UMBRIDGE:
Weasleys... Fred and George appear high above the chaos on their broomsticks, wave cheerily at Umbridge. SILVER ROCKETS RICOCHET off the walls, the wind from them WHIPPING up test papers from the desks into a miniature tornado, sending them soaring up into the rafters... A barrage of shocking-pink CATHERINE WHEELS whiz toward Umbridge; she ducks just in time as they soar out the window. She spins around in outrage, sputters:

UMBRIDGE:
FILCH!! Fred and George taunt Filch as he tries swatting at them with his broom--which promptly bursts into flames.

FRED:
So long! We won't be seeing you!

GEORGE:
Don't bother to keep in touch, you old bat! As the TWINS soar out the doors Umbridge follows them out--

REVERSE:
The trio, surrounded by cheering students, watches from the doorway as the twins dwindle into a glorious pink and gold sunset. And then Harry's grin slowly fades to confusion. Something's wrong. SOUND begins to die. As we PUSH IN on the trio we see the blood draining from Harry's face. Something's very wrong. He suddenly FLINCHES with the pain of a thousand volts--ZZZP--

FLASH CUT:
Voldemort opens his eyes; his snake-slits IRIS-- HARRY Terror growing as we continue to PUSH IN. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville and others still cheering in SLOW MOTION as bits of burning proclamation fall like confetti, all in eerie SILENCE--ZZZP--

FLASH CUT:
Sirius's FACE, contorted in agony-- HARRY Shaking, white as a sheet now as Hermione finally notices, turns in slow motion toward him, silently mouthing his name--as we PUSH relentlessly into Harry's eye--

VOLDEMORT:
I cannot touch it...but you can. VOLDEMORT steps aside to reveal a huddled FIGURE on the floor. Sirius lifts his head, his face twisted in pain.

SIRIUS:
You'll have to kill me.

VOLDEMORT:
Oh I will. But first you will fetch it for me. CRUCIO! Sirius writhes in agony. As he contorts we suddenly GLIMPSE in the distance a familiar PLAIN BLACK DOOR--our view ROCKETS towards it at the speed of thought--and suddenly WITHOUT A CUT we pull back from the OTHER side of the door to reveal

HERMIONE:
Harry, are you sure?

HARRY:
I saw it--just like with Mr. Weasley! It's the same door I've been dreaming about for months-- only I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before! (they don't understand) Sirius said Voldemort was after something--something he didn't (MORE)

HARRY:
have last time--and it's in the Department of Mysteries!

HERMIONE:
Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?

HARRY:
What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die?! (desperately) Hermione--he's the only family I've got left. Hermione is truly torn. She turns to find Ron looking at her--and the loyalty and resolve in his eyes says it all. Hermione takes a deep breath--and nods. Ron turns to Harry.

RON:
What do we do.

HARRY:
The portkey in Dumbledore's office is locked up...we'll have to use the Floo Network.

HERMIONE:
But Umbridge has all the chimneys under surveillance!

HARRY:
Not hers. I have an idea...

HARRY:
Alohomora--!

HARRY:
Alert the Order if you can--

RON:
Are you mental? We're going with you!

HARRY:
It's too dangerous--!

HERMIONE:
When are you going to get it through your head, Harry--we're in this together!

UMBRIDGE:
That--you--are. The trio spins to find a wildly disheveled Umbridge, a mad gleam in her eye--wand extended. ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER Harry is bound to a chair. Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Luna are each held by a member of the Inquisitorial Squad. Umbridge's rage is at a fever pitch.

UMBRIDGE:
Take their wands. Crabbe, Goyle and Warrington roughly comply, as Malfoy brings in Neville, a wand at his back.

DRACO MALFOY:
Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl. Ginny kicks Malfoy in the shins; he HOWLS--and stumbles into a pile of items confiscated from the Room of Requirement. Ron's eyes fall on a stack of familiar bright ORANGE BOXES...as Umbridge turns on Harry.

UMBRIDGE:
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you.

HARRY:
No--

UMBRIDGE:
(she SMACKS him)

UMBRIDGE:
Snape. Yes. The time has come for answers--whether he wants to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum?

SNAPE:
I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students; the last of it on Miss Chang... (the trio reacts) Unless you wish to poison him--and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy if you did--I cannot help you. If that will be all... Harry watches as he turns to go; blurts out desperately.

HARRY:
He's got Padfoot! He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden! Snape stops...slowly turns.

UMBRIDGE:
Padfoot? What is "Padfoot?" Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape? Snape pauses for an excruciatingly long moment, then:

SNAPE:
No idea. And he is gone. Umbridge pauses....then slowly turns back to Harry. Automatically straightens the wands laid out on her desk...

UMBRIDGE:
Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is an issue of Ministry security, you leave me with no alternative... (taking our her wand) The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue...

HERMIONE:
(gasps) That's illegal!

UMBRIDGE:
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. After all, he never knew I ordered the attack on Potter last summer.

HARRY:
You sent the Dementors?!

UMBRIDGE:
Somebody had to act! All that useless deliberating about what should be done, or whether this or the other were true--but I was the one who actually did something! Only you wriggled out of that one, didn't you, Potter? Not today though...not now... (she raises her wand) CRUC--

HERMIONE:
Tell her, Harry!

UMBRIDGE:
Tell me...what? Harry stares at Hermione, bewildered.

HERMIONE:
Well if you won't tell her where it is, I will! It's not worth another student dying!

UMBRIDGE:
Where what is?

HERMIONE:
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

UMBRIDGE:
How much further?

HERMIONE:
Not far. It had to be somewhere students weren't going to find it accidentally.

HARRY:
What are you doing?

HERMIONE:
Improvising.

UMBRIDGE:
Well? Where is this weapon? Hermione looks helplessly at Harry.

UMBRIDGE:
(realizing) There isn't one...is there. You were trying to trick me. Umbridge pauses--Harry and Hermione brace for the explosion--then, her voice quivering:

UMBRIDGE:
You know...I really hate children. You really are the most... (searches for the darkest imaginable epithet) ...untidy creatures. Lord knows I've tried to help you...to instill discipline, and respect for decorum. I've tried my very best to bring order, yet at every turn been assailed by chaos... She now seems on the brink of a nervous breakdown. She regards her ruined frock, her flyaway hair.

UMBRIDGE:
I MEAN LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME! I really cannot take it anymore... (then) But I must! Authority must be upheld! Sometimes the ends do justify the means--and certainly no one could blame me... (MORE)

UMBRIDGE:
(steeling herself) ...and if it falls to me to sort out the mess--to tie up the loose ends--then so be it. For the greater good I will do what must be done-- She raises her wand-- A GUTTURAL VOICE barks in an ANCIENT TONGUE. Umbridge whirls...slowly looks up as a CENTAUR (MAGORIAN) steps forward. He has long black hair; his face and body are covered with WAR MARKINGS. He holds a cocked BOW in his powerful arms.

UMBRIDGE:
Y-You have no business here, Centaur! This is a Ministry matter... Magorian reacts--SPEAKS LOW as another Centaur--BANE-- steps forward, bow also raised. Nervously:

UMBRIDGE:
Lower your weapons! I warn you-- any attack on a Ministry Official by a half-breed is-- Bane spits a furious RESPONSE to Magorian. More CENTAURS step forward as Umbridge continues, growing hysterical--

UMBRIDGE:
Under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence-- ZING--Bane looses an arrow. It sails toward Umbridge-- who RAISES her WAND--PROTEGO!--the arrow bounces harmlessly to the side.

UMBRIDGE:
HOW DARE YOU! FILTHY HALF-BREED--! (raising her WAND) CRUCIO! Bane stumbles in agony. Hermione SCREAMS. Umbridge's eyes gleam as she uses her wand to force the proud Centaur to its knees--it STUMBLES, rolls down the hill to her feet--

HERMIONE:
STOP IT! STOP! The CENTAURS on the ridge DRAW THEIR BOWS--Umbridge raises her wand-- --as Hermione throws herself in front of the fallen Centaur; Harry quickly joining her.

UMBRIDGE:
ENOUGH! I WILL--HAVE--ORDER--!! She aims her wand-- --suddenly a tree trunk CRACKS behind her, as a giant HAND grabs Umbridge around the waist--she drops her wand-- Umbridge looks up in speechless horror as GRAWP glares furiously down at her through broken yellow teeth.

GRAWP:
NO--HURT--HERMY--!

HERMIONE:
(touched) He remembered... Umbridge SCREAMS. The CENTAURS REAR UP at the towering Giant--

UMBRIDGE:
UNHAND ME, YOU ANIMAL! Annoyed, Grawp covers her mouth with his thumb, muffling her continuing SCREAMS. As the Centaurs recover, advance on Grawp with drawn bows Harry and Hermione share a frightened look--

HERMIONE:
No--please! He doesn't understand! A timeless beat as GRAWP frowns uneasily at the Centaurs... then slowly looks down at Umbridge, putting two and two together. She looks up at him in dawning horror...

UMBRIDGE:
Now--now listen here... (calls, desperately) POTTER--DO SOMETHING--TELL THEM I MEAN NO HARM--!

HARRY:
I'm sorry, Professor...I must not tell lies. Umbridge's eyes widen--Grawp sniffs her head dubiously. Makes a disgusted face-- --then absently DROPS her. Magorian is already signaling two Centaurs--who instantly gallop alongside Umbridge, each grabbing an arm. Her legs kick uselessly in the air--

UMBRIDGE:
UNHAND ME YOU BEASTS--you ANIMALS!! I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge! Let me GOOOooo---!!

BANE:
(seething) You cannot trust them--they are humans.

MAGORIAN:
They are young. We do not attack foals.

BANE:
Not so young-- (he aims at Harry, who holds his breath) This one is nearing manhood.

MAGORIAN:
True...But there remains the scent of innocence about him. A tense moment of standoff between the two Centaurs-- then Bane snorts in disgust, turns and gallops away. Harry and Hermione sag in relief as Magorian turns to them; quietly:

MAGORIAN:
Go, humans. He too gallops off...as Harry and Hermione turn to find Grawp has wandered off and is now sitting in the middle of a BED OF FLOWERS. He's still sniffing his Umbridge hand dubiously as they approach.

HERMIONE:
Thank you, Grawp. She stands up on tiptoes to kiss his cheek. Grawp blushes... then reaches down and pulls up the entire bed of flowers, gently tosses them toward Hermione. Petals rain down on her and Harry as they smile gratefully up at him through the cascade...then Harry turns to Hermione.

HARRY:
Sirius.

HERMIONE:
How did you get away?

RON:
Told 'em I was hungry and wanted some sweets. 'Course they said bugger off and ate it all themselves.

GINNY:
Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

HERMIONE:
(truly impressed) Ron! That was clever.

RON:
(flushing) It has been known to happen.

NEVILLE:
It was brilliant! But how are we going to get to London...? Hermione and Ron's eyes go instantly to Harry. Torn:

HARRY:
Look...it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is, and... Luna frowns. Hermione just looks at him, terribly disappointed. Harry frowns...

NEVILLE:
(quietly) Dumbledore's Army was supposed to be about doing something real. Or was that all just words to you? Harry hesitates. Ron looks at him; gently: RON Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate. A long moment...he takes in their faces...then--an open appeal:

HARRY:
So how are we going to get to London?

LUNA:
(smiling beatifically) We fly, of course.

HARRY:
It's this way.

LIFT VOICE:
Department of Mysteries. Harry hurries down the corridor, turns the corner--and stops at the sight of the BLACK DOOR at the end of the

HARRY:
Stay behind me. Once we've found Sirius I'll create a diversion-- you just get him out of danger quick as you can...

HERMIONE:
But V-Voldemort... It's still hard for her to say his name. Harry hesitates-- turns back to the door--

HARRY:
(grim) Leave Voldemort to me. Harry takes a deep breath. Opens the door--

HARRY:
Lumos. His WAND TIP FLARES but the black void seems to suck up all the light. As Harry takes point, the others fall into an arrow formation behind him. FROM HIGH ABOVE: The tiny group makes their way through the blackness...a sudden dark WHOOSH wipes frame--

WITH THE SIX:
Their FOOTSTEPS ECHO as we study their nervous faces... extended wands... trembling hands... As they approach a CROSSROADS of two WIDER AISLES, Harry notes the LABELS on the end of each row: ROW 95, 96...97. Harry silently raises his hand to stop the others, who exchange nervous glances. Harry flattens himself against the end of the shelf--slowly peers around the corner, wand extended... Empty.

HARRY:
He should be here! Harry looks around wildly--down row after empty row.

HARRY:
(his voice echoing) SIRIUS!! (returns) They've done something with him! Taken him somewhere else, or--

HERMIONE:
(scared) Harry--what if Sirius was never here at all?

HARRY:
What? But I saw--

HERMIONE:
What if Voldemort learned about the connection between you--and tricked you into only thinking you saw him? Harry stares at her, unwilling to believe it.

NEVILLE:
(calls) Harry... Harry turns to see Neville peering up at a glowing GLOBE high on a shelf. He turns to Harry.

NEVILLE:
It's got your name on it. As Harry approaches the SHELF SILENTLY LOWERS ITSELF to Harry's level, as if presenting the globe to him. The dusty LABEL beneath it reads: S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D. Dark Lord and (?) Harry Potter. As the globe reaches Harry its low throbbing HUM grows more powerful; it lights up his face with an ethereal GLOW. Transfixed, Harry reaches for it--

HERMIONE:
(worried) Harry...

HARRY:
(simply) It's got my name on it.

TRELAWNEY:
The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... A DISTANT SCREAM rapidly grows louder. With enormous difficulty Harry tears his focus away from the globe--to find Hermione holding a frightened Ginny--Harry stares at her in confusion--Ginny points-- Harry turns--to see a TALL, DARK FIGURE, silhouetted against the blackness--Voldemort? But as it steps into the light we see its hooded, hideous mask: a DEATH EATER.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Very good, Potter... TWO MORE DEATH EATERS (DOLOHOV and ROOKWOOD) seem to form from the shadows behind Malfoy, flanking him. [This effect should seem somewhat eerie but mostly realistic-- we won't reveal magic is involved until later.]

LUCIUS MALFOY:
...now give me the Prophecy. Harry's eyes widen in confusion. He turns to take in the endless rows--

HARRY:
Sirius--

LUCIUS MALFOY:
It's time you learned the difference between reality and dreams, Potter--you saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now give. That. To me. Harry slowly looks down at the globe in his hands. Then:

HARRY:
Get behind me. (the others realize, fall back. To Malfoy:) If you want to get to us you're going to have to smash this first. [Something tells me your boss wouldn't be too pleased about that.]

BELLATRIX LESTRANGE:
Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter... Another Death Eaters HISSES, steps forward. Familiar mad eyes glitter behind the mask: BELLATRIX LESTRANGE. She raises her wand--

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Bellatrix, no.

NEVILLE:
(eyes widening) Bellatrix Lestrange. A spark of delighted recognition dawns in Bellatrix' eyes.

BELLATRIX LESTRANGE:
Master Longbottom! How's Mum and Dad?

NEVILLE:
B-better, now they're about to be avenged. Bellatrix's smile twists into a sneer of rage--she abruptly raises her wand--

NEVILLE:
EXPELLIARMUS! Just as a JET OF FIERY LIGHT shoots from Bellatrix' wand Neville's spell PULLS it from her hand. His eyes widen in amazement as the EXPLOSION rocks the shelf a foot to Harry's left, SHATTERING several globes. Two SMOKELIKE FIGURES unfurl from the broken glass, MURMUR inaudibly.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
DO NOT ATTACK. WE NEED THAT PROPHECY.

HARRY:
I don't understand. Why did Voldemort need me to come get it?

BELLATRIX LESTRANGE:
Filthy half-blood. You dare speak his name! Malfoy restrains Bellatrix; icily:

LUCIUS MALFOY:
As those who died trying to acquire it for the Dark Lord learned-- prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. (MORE)

LUCIUS MALFOY:
(changing tacks; seductively) Haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as an infant? The reason for the connection between you? The secret...of your scar? You hold the answer in your hands. Come-- let me show it to you... Harry looks down at the glowing orb--hesitates--then:

HARRY:
I've been waiting fourteen years... I guess I can wait a little longer. NOW--!!

LUNA:
races down an aisle, looking behind her in terror--and runs straight into a huge DEATH EATER. She stares up at him in horror--turns to run but he grabs her brutally around the neck. Kicking and struggling desperately, she spots his DARK MARK floating on his arm--and suddenly BITES it, hard. The Death Eater cries out, drops her. Luna scrambles away on hands and knees-- --and runs right into another DEATH EATER. As the two advance on her she looks wildly back and forth-- The first Death Eater raises his wand--FIRES--but at the last second Luna DIVES for cover, the JET OF FIRE SIZZLING JUST OVER HER HEAD, singeing her hair--it hits the second Death Eater, sending him flying into a shelf-- and giving Luna the diversion she needs to fire a BLAST at the first, who goes sprawling. As Luna scrambles through a small GAP between Globes on the bottom shelf, we TRACK THROUGH IT WITH HER--

NEVILLE:
stands stunned and mute, wand in hand, looking down at a PETRIFIED DEATH EATER, his arms still reaching skywards clutching at nothing. Neville seems equally frozen, utterly stunned at his accomplishment. For a long moment Luna just stands there, breathing hard, staring at Neville, breathing hard, staring at the Death Eater, not breathing at all. Finally:

LUNA:
Well done, Neville. Neville remains utterly oblivious,. Another endless moment of mutual breathing...and then an EXPLOSION goes off nearby. Startled into action, Luna grabs Neville by the hand--

LUNA:
Come on, Neville. You can do it some more. As she pulls Neville off he continues to stare back at the frozen Death Eater in stunned amazement... ...as we abruptly TRACK laterally THROUGH THE SHELVES, to FIND

RON AND HERMIONE:
racing down an aisle, SHOOTING OFF SPELLS behind them as they are pursued by Two Death Eaters. Hermione wings one of them but the other remains hot on their trail. Seeing the GHOSTLY FOG inside some of the Prophecies she's running past, Hermione gets an idea-- --and USES HER WAND to TRIP a ROW OF PROPHECIES off their stands. Ron, realizing what she's doing, immediately does likewise-- In rapid succession orbs EXPLODE on the floor like giant light bulbs. RISING MURMURING GHOSTLY FIGURES obscure the Death Eater's view; as he struggles through the mist RED BOLTS of FIRE FLASH in the fog around him; he takes a HIT, VANISHING into the fog-- --as Ron and Hermione approach the end of the aisle suddenly a HUGE DEATH EATER appears from the darkness, blocking their way. A FLASH of LIGHT as Ron takes a HIT to his arm, goes flying--

RON:
STUPEFY--!! The Death Eater goes SPINNING round and CRASHING into the shelves--as a shower of PROPHECIES rain down on him, knocking him out cold-- --but leaving Hermione floating in mid-air. We STAY WITH HER as she SCREAMS, tumbling through space-- --abruptly stopping as she lands in Ron's arms. Ron is as just as stunned as Hermione, who stares at Ron, as if seeing him with new eyes. Finally:

RON:
Better keep running.

HERMIONE:
(instantly) Right. They race off-- TRACKING WITH HARRY on the run through the maze. As he races through the endless disorienting rows and aisles we hear VOICES CRY out in the darkness. Suddenly a DEATH EATER seems almost to form from the shadows right in front of him--Harry sends it flying with a STUPEFY, races back the other way--only to find another APPEAR--seemingly out of nowhere--before him. HARRY sends it too flying, but-- nightmarishly--TWO MORE instantly take its place. He turns again--to see MALFOY striding toward him, wand extended, ROARING--

LUCIUS MALFOY:
GIVE IT TO ME--! Again Harry turns to run--but he's surrounded-- --and then his eyes lock onto GINNY breathing hard, visible watching THROUGH the prophecies on a shelf. They lock eyes. She raises her wand, takes a deep breath--

GINNY:
Y-you were right, Harry. This isn't at all like being in school. Suddenly a DEEP RUMBLING is heard. As Harry and Ginny slowly turn their eyes widen in disbelief: The falling SHELF has caused a CHAIN REACTION--SHELF after SHELF toppling like the worlds largest dominos. Headed straight for them. Harry grabs Ginny's hand as they race away from the chaos--and down the long aisle toward the distant doors. TWENTY YARDS AHEAD of them Neville and Luna suddenly spill into the main aisle, also racing for the line of DOORS--after a moment Ron and Hermione tumble out of another aisle, joining Neville and Luna-- HIGH ANGLE - PLUME'S POV We DIVE TOWARD THE SMALL FIGURES of HARRY and GINNY, smashing THROUGH the shelves, exploding GLOBES left and right--raining FIRE down on Harry and Ginny--

GINNY:
CRIES out in pain as BOLT hits her leg; she stumbles. Looks behind her in terror at the approaching WAVE OF DESTRUCTION. Harry quickly helps her up, holds her as she limps bravely onward-- NEAR THE DOOR the four look helplessly as the Wave approaches Harry and Ginny--

HERMIONE:
HURRY!

RON:
"Department of Mysteries..." Got that one right, didn't they... And now as the Six look around we see they are standing on huge stones that make up the floor of a vast AMPHITHEATER, its RISERS dwindling into infinity. In the center of the space is a DAIS, upon which stands a cracked and crumbling STONE ARCHWAY. It is hung with a tattered BLACK VEIL, which sways eerily in an invisible

HARRY:
The voices. Can you tell what they're saying? Ron and Hermione share a chilled look.

HERMIONE:
There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here-- Luna approaches the fluttering veil, rapt. The breeze rustles her hair.

LUNA:
I hear them too.

HERMIONE:
It's just an empty archway! Please Harry, they'll be here any-- Too late. A HOWLING WIND draws her gaze upwards--where HIGH ABOVE, TEN PLUMES OF THICK BLACK SMOKE are billowing toward them. Harry looks around. There's no where to run. The Six stand abreast. The PLUMES SCREAM in. SIX WANDS RISE in unison--

THE SIX:
STUPEFY--!! --but it's too late--their voices are swallowed in the deafening WIND as now TWO MORE PLUMES sweep down behind them from opposite directions--the Six spin in confusion-- And then the other PLUMES are there, SPIRALING DOWN AROUND THEM, creating a TORNADO EFFECT. As the grotesque forms of half-reconstituted Death Eaters HOWL PAST one by one each of the kids is SUCKED into the maelstrom. Finally only Harry is left, hugging the Prophecy to his chest-- And then suddenly the ROAR of the wind dwindles to silence. Harry looks up from the ground--to see each of his friends held at wandpoint in a circle around him. Malfoy begins to laugh.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Did you actually believe...Were you really naive enough to think that children stood a chance against...us? Harry looks helplessly at the others. Malfoy holds out his hand.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
The Prophecy.

NEVILLE:
(his nose bleeding) DON'T GIB IT TO DEM, HARRY! Dolohov roughly twists Neville's arm behind his back.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
I'll make it easy for you, Potter. Give it to me now...or watch them die. Beaten, Harry haltingly steps forward...and hands Malfoy the Prophecy. Malfoy raises the glowing orb up to his face, illuminating a cruel smile:

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Kill the spares. [ALT: Kill them.] QUICK CUTS: Harry stares. Ron and Hermione exchange a last look. Ginny and Luna clasp hands. Neville steels himself, looks unblinkingly at-- BELLATRIX. Grinning horribly, she raises her wand--draws an ecstatic breath to cast the killing spell-- --then suddenly her wand goes flying from her hand-- Rookwood and Dolohov's are stripped from theirs as well-- Harry whirls--all heads turn--to see SIRIUS step from shadow into light, his dark eyes shining.

SIRIUS:
Get away from my Godson. And with that he PUNCHES Malfoy brutally in the jaw-- --as the Prophecy goes sailing out of his hands. Malfoy stares in stunned disbelief as it SMASHES on the stone. As the pearly-white figure of SYBILL TRELAWNEY rises from the broken glass and DISSOLVES INTO SMOKE Malfoy falls to his knees, holds up the broken shards in horror--

LUCIUS MALFOY:
No... Now the SOUND of RUSHING WIND spins the heads of the stunned Death Eaters as a WHITE VAPOR TRAIL circles in from above-- --as the kids use the diversion to elbow, kick and pull free of their captors. Simultaneously Sirius grabs Harry, pulls him to the ground just as the VAPOR TRAIL ROCKETS OVERHEAD--and an ARC of WHITE LIGHTNING shoots from it, FORKING and SPLITTING into multiple BOLTS that send Death Eaters flying left and right-- --as the WHITE PLUME COALESCES into Tonks, spinning balletically as she lands gracefully on the run-- --suddenly TRIPS-- --then catches herself at the last moment, sticking her landing. MORE WHITE VAPOR TRAILS are streaming in from all directions; in disarray, the DEATH EATERS fire spells off wildly as the WHITE PLUMES COALESCE into Lupin-- Moody--Shacklebolt--all in motion, wands blazing. Tonks quickly helps shepherd the KIDS out of harms way as THE BATTLE BEGINS--

SIMULTANEOUS ACTION:
HIGH ON A RISER MADEYE MOODY is in his glory, sending spells BOOMING left and right. A DEATH EATER comes at him from behind--but Moody's EYE SPINS in his socket--

MADEYE MOODY:
Oh no you don't, Boyo-- Moody ELBOWS him brutally, grabs him, yanks him around and HEAD BUTTS him. As Moody watches him crash down the risers, he takes a hit from his flask, BELCHES with satisfaction-- A DEATH EATER SCREAMS like a banshee as he flies toward Shacklebolt--who just calmly fires a carefully aimed shot that sends him twirling fifty feet through the air. Just then ROOKWOOD ROCKETS UPWARDS, transforming into a black PLUME as he sends FIRE raining down on Shacklebolt--who, without missing a beat, aims over his shoulder-- --and hits the BILLOWING TRAIL dead on. Rookwood RECONSTITUTES in mid-air--plummets, FLAILING helplessly-- as Shacklebolt whirls with a flourish, wand already sweeping toward its next target--

SIRIUS:
leans over Harry in concern; helps him sit up. They are just out of the battlezone, in the SHADOW of the ARCH.

SIRIUS:
Harry--are you all right? Harry is overwhelmed with joy and relief at seeing his Godfather unharmed.

HARRY:
Sirius...I thought...I mean I saw...

SIRIUS:
(gently) I know. But's it all right. I'm fine. (a moment...then an EXPLOSION goes off nearby) Listen to me: I want you to take the others and get out of here--

HARRY:
What? No! I'm staying with you!

SIRIUS:
Harry--

HARRY:
Sirius, I won't lose you again! Sirius looks at his Godson. For a moment the SOUNDS of the BATTLE grow distant.

SIRIUS:
Harry...my life...has largely been a wasted one. Twelve years in Azkaban. Living on the run. The one good thing in it...has been you. Don't take that away from me. (Harry is torn) Besides... Sirius is looking beyond him. Harry turns, follows his gaze...to where where Tonks is helping the other kids, bruised and battered. Luna is still very shaky; Ron helps the limping Ginny.

SIRIUS:
They need their leader. Harry looks at his friends--back at Sirius--and finally, reluctantly nods. Sirius smiles-- BOOM! Harry darts across the no-man's land of EXPLOSIONS and strobing colored LIGHT. As he reaches the others, headed toward the amphitheater DOORWAY, Tonks squeezes his shoulder, then rushes back into the fray. As Harry watches her go he takes a last look at the battle--his searching eyes find Shacklebolt--Lupin--then

SIRIUS:
dueling Malfoy before the VEIL. BOLTS of FIRE explode from their wands as they circle, each seeking the high ground. Malfoy is good--very good. He battles Sirius back, gaining the advantage--

LUCIUS MALFOY:
You should have stayed in hiding, Black!

SIRIUS:
When I'm done with you, Malfoy-- (deftly tossing his wand from hand to hand) --you'll wish I had. Sirius backs up onto the DAIS, sends a multicolored BARRAGE OF FLAMES at Malfoy. Malfoy ducks behind the Arch--but suddenly a BOLT comes at Sirius from behind-- he spins to find BELLATRIX. She HISSES as she fires again--he nimbly dodges it.

SIRIUS:
Come now Cousin, we can do better than that! Bellatrix fires--but as Sirius moves to evade it he is blocked by another SIZZLING BOLT from Malfoy--and Sirius takes a painful HIT in the side--

HARRY:
Can't take it anymore. Hermione sees it. With quiet urgency:

LUCIUS MALFOY:
The Dark Lord will be pleased indeed. Today will see both the end of Harry Potter--and the Order of the Phoenix! Suddenly Malfoy is BLASTED, sent flying. A wild-eyed Sirius looks up to see HARRY--

SIRIUS:
Good one, James! Harry stares at Sirius. Dolohov sends a BOLT OF FIRE at him--who dodges as he spins back into action. Caught in the crossfire, Harry and Sirius are dueling back to back. Sirius is ebullient, taking all comers. And then IN THE FOREGROUND a bloodied BELLATRIX rises into view, unseen. She takes shaky aim at Sirius--at the last second Harry sees--

HARRY:
Sirius, look out--!

SIRIUS:
It's all right Harry! I'm back-- He laughs triumphantly as Bellatrix FIRES-- --and a jet of light hits Sirius squarely on the chest. His laughter is still ringing as his eyes widen in surprise--

HARRY:
Sirius? With dawning horror he starts toward the veil, but Lupin is there to hold him back.

LUPIN:
No, Harry--he's gone. Harry is stunned. Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna white- faced. Harry struggles against Lupin's grip, refusing to believe it.

LUPIN:
Harry, no--!

HARRY:
CRUCIO!! Bellatrix SCREAMS as a FLASH of light knocks her off her feet-- Harry is there. On fire, his wand pointed at her head. She looks up at him in terror--

BELLATRIX LESTRANGE:
(whispers) No--

ON HARRY:
Hatred and murder blazing in his eyes--a timeless moment-- And then from the inky blackness beyond him a bone-white visage emerges, swims toward us.

VOLDEMORT:
(softly) Do it. [ALT: You've got to mean it, Harry.] Voldemort draws closer. He is gentle, sympathetic... reasonable.

VOLDEMORT:
She killed him. She deserves it--

BELLATRIX LESTRANGE:
M-master--I tried, but, the Animagus Black, he--

VOLDEMORT:
Don't speak to me. Or can you restore my broken Prophecy? Bellatrix is terrified into silence.

VOLDEMORT:
You know the spell. Do it-- Bellatrix looks pleadingly at Harry--Harry is on the brink--his wand trembling-- --and then a flash of LIGHT illuminates his face.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry. Harry tears his eyes away from Bellatrix...to see Dumbledore's pained, kindly eyes.

VOLDEMORT:
You're too late, old man. The boy knows the truth.

HARRY:
(barely audible) What truth.

VOLDEMORT:
That you've been lied too... betrayed...just as I once was. (his eyes burn at Dumbledore, then:) Tell me Harry: do you know the real reason your Godfather died?

HARRY:
BECAUSE SHE KILLED HIM--!! Harry again raises his wand--Bellatrix cringes in terror--

VOLDEMORT:
NO. Because he "loved" you. He spits the word contemptuously.

VOLDEMORT:
Why did your mother and father die? Why will your friends die, when their turn comes--as it will? What has this "love" that he exalts above all else ever brought you but pain, and despair, and terrible, terrible loss...? (intensely) It doesn't exist, Harry. It's a fairy tale. A lie that the weak enshrine--and the shrewd exploit.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry--

VOLDEMORT:
Just look at him--the great Dumbledore! As if he cared a whit about you--!

HARRY:
(like a little boy) That's not true!

VOLDEMORT:
He cares only to the extent you're useful to him. You're but a pawn in his great chess match against me...it's all you've ever been. And this "love" he professes... (MORE)

VOLDEMORT:
(quietly) ...that's the greatest illusion of all. Mine is a hard truth... but it is the truth. You are alone. Dumbledore continues to look at Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way.

VOLDEMORT:
Yes. By which time I shall be gone, and you dead-- Suddenly a SCALDING ROPE OF FIRE arcs from his wand. With a SWOOP of his WAND Dumbledore FLINGS Harry out of the line of fire--he's SLAMMED against the wall, Dumbledore shielding him like a lion guarding a cub-- --BELLATRIX sees her chance, bolts toward the fireplaces-- --even as Dumbledore's WAND whips around and ANOTHER ROPE OF FIRE emanates from it, SMASHES into the first--

TIGHT ON HARRY:
LIGHTS STROBE and ARC across his face as the two great Wizards to battle, the very walls TREMBLING. RUBBLE and SHATTERED TILES fall in slow motion around him. But it all seems distant, remote as we PUSH IN on Harry, crushed with grief.

DUMBLEDORE AND VOLDEMORT:
are face to face, the power emanating from their wands blowing back Dumbledore's hair, creating a miniature HURRICANE around them. Voldemort sneers contemptuously--and vanishes. Instantly the fiery rope TRANSFORMS into a FIFTY-FOOT HIGH SERPENT, HISSING furiously-- With a burst of FLAME Voldemort reappears on the plinth in the fountain. He watches as the SERPENT rears high above Dumbledore--strikes-- --and suddenly implodes into smoke, quickly dissipates revealing an unharmed, albeit slightly-singed Dumbledore. Voldemort's smile fades--and then the WATER in the pool begins to RISE UP, covering him like a cocoon of molten glass. His rippling faceless figure struggles to throw off the suffocating mass--suddenly goes still as he again vanishes, and the water CRASHES to the floor--

HARRY:
dimly becomes aware of what's going on. SOUND is distant, swimming...slowly his eyes focus as he looks up-- HARRY'S POV The surreal sight of the two great Wizards battling. Flashes of LIGHTNING brilliantly illuminate the darkened atrium. Harry tries to focus, peers at their faces-- Voldemort, radiating power--Dumbledore grim-- As EXPLOSIONS rock the walls HARRY struggles to clear his head--

VOLDEMORT:
suddenly inhales deeply--focuses intently-- --as a SHOCK WAVE explodes out through his wand. It sends Dumbledore sprawling, knocking the wind out of him-- --as the wave RADIATES OUTWARD, SHATTERING the glass in the towering wall of WINDOWS above. The falling deadly rain SWOOPS OVER VOLDEMORT'S HEAD at the last moment, directed by his wand into a torrent of SHARDS headed straight for Dumbledore, still on the floor, still momentarily DAZED. The GLASS SINGS towards him-- --as just in time Dumbledore grimaces--digs deep--turns on his elbows-- --producing a SILVERY PATRONUS SHIELD. The GLASS SHARDS slow, STOP IN MID AIR, QUIVERING as they're caught between two mighty spells-- Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are straining--stalemated-- And then Dumbledore sees something from the corner of his eye: Harry. Shaky, disoriented, barely upright; wand in hand. Voldemort sees him too--hesitates-- --as Dumbledore uses the diversion to press his advantage--his PATRONUS SHIELD instantly ENVELOPS the GLASS, SPIRALS TIGHT AROUND IT and IMPLODES.... ...leaving only SAND, which swirls and eddies harmlessly across the Atrium floor. Suddenly the great space rings with SILENCE. Dumbledore climbs wearily to his feet. On the verge of breakdown, Harry stares at him--winded, sweat on his brow--as if he doesn't know him.

DUMBLEDORE:
(alarmed) Harry... Now Harry's eyes are drawn inexorably to Voldemort's piercing gaze. Harry instinctively stumbles back in fear. He looks anxiously back and forth between the two wizards, his wand TREMBLING-- Voldemort regards Harry with genuine pity.

VOLDEMORT:
(softly) So weak...so vulnerable... ...and then--we see it--an idea registers in Voldemort's eyes. His gaze moves to Dumbledore... Voldemort smiles. He closes his eyes, grows still. A WIND starts to rise. As Dumbledore realizes --

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry! Stay where you are--! --Voldemort vanishes-- Harry stares in confusion-- --and then A BURST OF WIND blows back Harry's hair; he CONVULSES in agony-- --and then suddenly he goes dead still. His eyes open-- now inert, lifeless--and TWO voices issue from his mouth. HARRY/VOLDEMORT You've lost, old man. Dumbledore stares back in helpless horror-- --as one last time we PUSH INTO HARRY'S EYE--ZZZP-- A KALEIDOSCOPIC FLURRY OF IMAGES A BLUR of random shots of Harry from throughout the films flash by, too quick to grasp--it is as if Voldemort is rifling through Harry's brain. Simultaneously a SUPERSONIC WHINE rises in pitch, becomes excruciating--ZZZP-- ZZZP--FLASH CUT--Sirius being blown back through the veil, fear rising in his eyes-- IN THE ATRIUM: Harry CONVULSES with pain-- ZZZP--FLASH CUT: YOUNG JAMES laughs as he floats Young Snape in mid-air--

VOLDEMORT:
LOOK AT ME! ZZZP. For a split second we are back in the Atrium--Harry CRIES OUT.

DUMBLEDORE:
Don't fight him Harry! You can't win, not on his terms. For an moment Harry is himself again--he stares back at Dumbledore uncomprehendingly... ...and then all SOUND drains from the scene. Time is suspended. Harry stares at Dumbledore's ancient, anguished face-- half in deep shadow, half in light...then:

SIRIUS:
We've all got both light and dark inside us... Suddenly Harry is back in the Tapestry room with Sirius.

SIRIUS:
What matters is the part we choose to act on... FLASH CUT: ADULT JAMES smiles out at us from the Photo of the Original Order, his arm around Sirius...

SIRIUS:
That's who we really are. Harry looks up at his smiling Godfather...then:

YOUNG LILY:
Why do you hate him so? Confused, Harry turns toward the voice-- --and finds himself on a familiar lawn, now empty except for YOUNG LILY. FLASH CUT--ADULT LILY turns in terror, holding INFANT HARRY--

HARRY:
Because he murdered you! Young Lily just looks sadly, compassionately at Harry. He stares at her in confusion, as the scene WHITES OUT-- IN THE ATRIUM, HARRY is fading. His heartbeat ECHOES as he starts to pass out. We sense this is his final moment. And then a distant VOICE reverberates through Harry's mind...

TRELAWNEY:
...but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... Dumbledore looks deeply into Harry's eyes. Softly: DUMBLEDORE Harry...it's not how you are alike--it's how you're not. Confusion...then the glimmer of understanding begins to grow in Harry's eyes. And now something draws his gaze beyond Dumbledore-- Ron and Hermione, breathless and fearful at the entrance of the smoking, ruined Atrium. Something clicks in Harry's head. His eyes widen as he REALIZES--

HARRY:
(whispers, realizing) You're the one who's weak! [ALT: You're not strong. You're weak.] He looks back at Ron and Hermione, gazing helplessly at him...then Luna, Neville, and Ginny appear behind them, bloody but unbowed. Tonks and Lupin quickly follow. Harry looks back. With the last of his strength--

HARRY:
You'll never know friendship--or love, or real happiness--and I-- FEEL--SORRY--FOR--YOU--!

VOLDEMORT:
You are a fool, Harry Potter... He reaches out to gently touch Harry's face.

VOLDEMORT:
And you will lose everything. A suspended moment--the world is FROZEN around the two of them--then-- BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!--FIREPLACES IGNITE in a quick succession of EMERALD BURSTS; loud VOICES ECHO all over the Atrium as FUDGE enters--stops, dumbstruck-- Voldemort looks evenly at Harry--and with another BLAST OF WIND he TWIRLS UP INTO THE AIR--VANISHES -- --as Harry collapses to the floor. And then Dumbledore is there, gently touching his face as Harry, shivering, stares up into his kindly eyes through his shattered glasses. In a moment they are surrounded by MINISTRY OFFICIALS--and a stunned Cornelius Fudge, pajamas visible under his robes. VOICES cry "I saw him!" "It was Voldemort, he was here!" Dumbledore looks up from Harry, his hard eyes meeting Fudge's...as Fudge sags in defeat.

FUDGE:
He's back. The scene is a chaos of rushing wizards, as Dumbledore turns lovingly back to Harry, who has finally passed out.

THRU	THRU:
147	147

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL:
"...we urge the magical population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary defense for all Wizarding homes..." As we reach Professor McGonagall, sitting in a wheelchair, she lowers her paper, looks up at HAGRID beside her. As the SUNLIGHT FADES they both look up. A PEAL OF THUNDER--

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry? Harry stops. Dumbledore turns--he is in a chair on the UPPER LEVEL of his office, facing the window. Subdued.

DUMBLEDORE:
Please. Come in? Harry hesitates. Unable to meet his gaze, he moves to the wall, his eyes falling on the artifacts of his youth...the SORTING HAT, GRYFFINDOR'S SWORD. He touches its blade...Dumbledore watches, uncertain how to begin.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry...I know how you must be feeling...

HARRY:
(simply) No. You don't. (then, his voice catching) It's my fault.

DUMBLEDORE:
No, Harry....the fault is mine. (Harry turns in surprise) If I had been open with you, as I should have been, you would have known long ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries. You would never have been tricked into going there... and Sirius would not have come after you. The blame lies with me, and with me alone. An old man's mistake...

HARRY:
(stares) You're Dumbledore. You don't make mistakes.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry...as much as it pains me to disillusion you, I am all too fallible...and this war that has now begun may just as easily be lost as won. THUNDER RUMBLES. For the first time Harry really looks at Dumbledore. He looks different since his battle with Voldemort. He looks, for the first time...old. Dumbledore turns to the window, RAIN now sheeting down it.

DUMBLEDORE:
I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort became aware of the connection between you, and tried to exploit it. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have all year, he would be less tempted, and you might thereby be protected. Another mistake... (turning to him) I'm sorry, Harry. Harry doesn't know what to say...then notices Dumbledore's HAND is TREMBLING. As Dumbledore massages his wrist Harry seems struck by this sign of frailty. Struggling:

HARRY:
The Prophecy said "neither can live while the other one survives..." (MORE)

HARRY:
(looking up) It means one of us has got to kill the other in the end?

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes.

HARRY:
Why didn't you tell me?

DUMBLEDORE:
(quietly) For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. For the same reason your friends saved you. (Harry doesn't understand) The reason I failed to tell you...was because after all these years...after all you've suffered... I couldn't bear to cause you any more pain. I cared too much. I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. Something releases in Harry. As Dumbledore rests a gentle hand on his shoulder, Harry looks out at the rain, not wanting Dumbledore to see his tears.

RON:
Feast's about to start.

HARRY:
Thanks Ron...but I'm not really in the mood. Ron frowns, hesitates.

RON:
You know...I'm not really that hungry. I could...

HARRY:
(smiles, grateful) No, you go on. I'll be all right.

HARRY:
How come you're not at the feast?

LUNA:
I'm trying to find my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.

HARRY:
That's awful.

LUNA:
Oh, it's all good fun...but as it's last night I really do need them back.

HARRY:
D'you want help finding them? Luna smiles, shakes her head. Then, softly: LUNA I'm sorry about your Godfather, Harry. She squeezes his hand. It's a small gesture, but somehow coming from Luna it means an enormous amount to Harry.

HARRY:
You sure you don't want help looking?

LUNA:
That's all right. Anyway, my Mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end... Her gaze rises...to find her SHOES, tied together, hanging from a chandelier. Luna sighs.

LUNA:
...if not always in the way we expect. (a moment, then) I think I'll just go and have some pudding. She smiles beatifically, then turns and goes. Harry looks after her, thoughtful...

HARRY:
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said.

HERMIONE:
What's that, Harry?

HARRY:
Even though we've got a fight ahead of us...we've also got one thing Voldemort doesn't have.

RON:
What's that?

HARRY:
(quietly) Something worth fighting for. He puts a hand on each of their shoulders, more grateful than ever for their friendship. Both Ron and Hermione look back, moved... ...and as the trio moves forward into the crowd they are joined by an excited Neville, Luna and Ginny...and then still more friends from Dumbledore's Army...and even some Slytherins offer shy smiles and grateful nods, as the train BLASTS STEAM...


HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE

BELLATRIX:
Narcissa!

BELLATRIX:
Cissy! You mustn’t do this. He can’t be trusted.

NARCISSA:
The Dark Lord trusts him.

BELLATRIX:
The Dark Lord is mistaken.

BELLATRIX:
Or so I believe.

NARCISSA:
Well, who can one trust these days?

BELLATRIX:
He lives in this Muggle dunghill? Wormtail glowers over his shoulder at her. They pass into...

SNAPE:
Run along, Wormtail.

NARCISSA:
I’ve nowhere else to turn, Severus.

BELLATRIX:
You must be joking.

NARCISSA:
I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --

SNAPE:
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. (eyes shifting) Put it down, Bella. We mustn’t touch what isn’t ours.

SNAPE:
As it so happens I’m aware of your situation, Narcissa.

BELLATRIX:
You? The Dark Lord told you?

SNAPE:
Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable. (MORE)

SNAPE:
Over the years I have played my part well. So well I’ve deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.

SNAPE:
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.

NARCISSA:
I... I don’t doubt you, Severus.

BELLATRIX:
You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --

NARCISSA:
He’s just a boy!

SNAPE:
I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. To provide some... protection.

NARCISSA:
Do you mean it, Severus?

SNAPE:
I can try.

NARCISSA:
Oh, Severus, please, if you would... (I would be forever in	* your debt.)	*

BELLATRIX:
Swear to it.

BELLATRIX:
Make the Unbreakable Vow. (as Snape looks away) You see. It’s just empty words. Oh he’ll try. He’ll give it his best effort. But when it matters most he’ll slither back into his hole. Bloody coward...

SNAPE:
Take out your wand.

BELLATRIX:
Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes.

SNAPE:
I will.

BELLATRIX:
And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?

SNAPE:
I will.

BELLATRIX:
And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?

SNAPE:
I will.

WAITRESS:
Harry Potter. Who’s Harry Potter?

HARRY:
Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a tosser.

WAITRESS:
Funny that paper of yours. Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move.

HARRY:
Really.

WAITRESS:
Thought I’d gone round the twist.

HARRY:
Hey. I was wondering...

WAITRESS:
Eleven. That’s when I get off. (the smile) You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.

DUMBLEDORE:
I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk. No light could resist it... (turning) You’ve been reckless this summer, Harry.

HARRY:
I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.

DUMBLEDORE:
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it? The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. (extending it) Do as I say.

HARRY:
I just Apparated, didn’t I?

DUMBLEDORE:
Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit their first time.

HARRY:
Can’t imagine why...

DUMBLEDORE:
Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right?

HARRY:
(glancing about) After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
Wand out, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
Lumos... The tip of Dumbledore’s WAND BLAZES. He sweeps the shadows. CALLS OUT.

DUMBLEDORE:
Horace! Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW HALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but nothing else. He starts down the hallway, toward the OPEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond comes INTO VIEW:

ARMCHAIR:
Merlin’s Beard! Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though briefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING, SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL- WORN lilac pajamas appears.

SLUGHORN:
(rubbing his rump) There’s no need to disfigure me, Albus!

DUMBLEDORE:
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

SLUGHORN:
It’s all in the upholstery. (patting his stomach) I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

DUMBLEDORE:
(nodding to the ceiling) Dragon’s blood.

SLUGHORN:
Yes, well, I couldn’t very well use wizard’s blood, could I? Oho!

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. (a droll whisper) Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One. Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.

DUMBLEDORE:
So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you?

SLUGHORN:
(blinking) S-someone else? I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.

SLUGHORN:
Oh all right! The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what that’s like? One can only say no to these people so many times before they...

DUMBLEDORE:
Take matters into their own hands? Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.

SLUGHORN:
I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.

DUMBLEDORE:
Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you? Mind?

DUMBLEDORE:
That was fun. May I use the loo?

SLUGHORN:
Don’t think I don’t know why you’re here, Albus! The answer is still no! Absolutely, unequivocally no! Dumbledore doesn’t respond. Slughorn glances at Harry. The silence is palpable. Awkward. A beat. Then:

SLUGHORN:
You look very like your father. Except for your eyes. You’ve got --

HARRY:
My mother’s eyes, yeah.

SLUGHORN:
(smiling softly) Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.

HARRY:
One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our year.

SLUGHORN:
Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m prejudiced! No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites! Look, there she is. Right up front.

SLUGHORN:
All mine, each and every one. Ex- students, I mean. You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet. (MORE)

SLUGHORN:
Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family except Sirius. Shame. Talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I’d have liked the set.

DUMBLEDORE:
Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns.

SLUGHORN:
Of course. But you’re not leaving?

DUMBLEDORE:
I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace. You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.

SLUGHORN:
All right! I’ll do it. But I’ll be wanting Professor Merrythought’s old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise! These are mad times we live in! Mad!

DUMBLEDORE:
Indeed they are.

HARRY:
Sir, exactly what was that all --

DUMBLEDORE:
You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That is why he is returning to Hogwarts. And it is crucial he return...

DUMBLEDORE:
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl.

HARRY:
It’s alright, sir. I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --

DUMBLEDORE:
You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

HARRY:
But, sir. What about Hedwig? And there’s my trunk --

DUMBLEDORE:
Both are waiting for you.

HARRY:
Sir? Dumbledore is gone. Harry rises, glances about. In the distance a CROOKED HOUSE shimmers. A PRETTY GIRL with RED HAIR flits briefly past an upstairs window. GINNY WEASLEY. 20	INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME - NIGHT	20 Ginny DASHES down a vertiginous staircase, flies into the kitchen and finds... 21	INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 21

GINNY:
Hedwig...? Mum!

GINNY:
Exactly. How’d you guess?

GINNY:
I’m joking, Mum. MRS. WEASLEY You’re worse than Fred and George.

GINNY:
Now you’re joking. I was only wondering when Harry got here.

GINNY:
Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of course.

GINNY:
Well his trunk’s in the kitchen. And his owl.

RON:
Harry? Did someone say Harry?

GINNY:
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

RON:
‘Course not. Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn’t I?

HERMIONE:
Was that an owl I heard?

HARRY:
Didn’t know. (a shrug)	* Dumbledore.

RON:
You’ve a bit of...

HARRY:
When’d you get here?

HERMIONE:
A few days ago. Though... for a bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming.

RON:
Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it’s too dangerous.

RON:
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy. Took a day or two, but she came round.

HARRY:
But we’re talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer? Hermione and Ron exchange another glance.

HERMIONE:
There’s been a lot of chatter lately. That he’s gotten... old.

HARRY:
Rubbish. He’s only -- what?

RON:
A hundred and fifty. Give or take a few years.

GEORGE:
We’ve got Fainting Fancy...

FRED:
Nosebleed Nougats...

GEORGE:
And just in time for school...

FRED:
Puking Pastilles!

FRED:
What’d you think, Harry?

HARRY:
Amazing.

GEORGE:
(to a browsing boy) Pocket that and you’ll pay in more than Galleons, my friend.

GEORGE:
Bloody urchins.

FRED:
A real money spinner that.

FRED:
Handy if you need to make a quick escape. Hello, ladies! George drops one of the lumps in Harry’s hand, turns to Ginny and Hermione, who peruse a display of “Wonder Witch Love Potions.”

GEORGE:
Yes, they do really work.

FRED:
Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you’re doing just fine on your own.

GINNY:
None of your business.

HERMIONE:
These are adorable.

FRED:
Aren’t they now. Pygmy Puffs. Can’t breed them fast enough.

RON:
How much for this?

RON:
How much for me?

RON:
But I’m your brother!

RON:
C’mon. Let’s go.

HERMIONE:
How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed down.

RON:
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.

HARRY:
Reckon he’s right...

HERMIONE:
Oh no. Look.

HERMIONE:
But everyone got their wands from Ollivander. Young. Old...

HARRY:
Good. Bad. Speaking of which...

RON:
Is it just me? Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don’t want to be followed?

RON:
What’re they playing at?

HARRY:
Dunno. Let’s get closer.

RON:
(a nod; stopping) Hey. Where’s Hermione?

RON:
Harry, where is she?

HARRY:
I don’t know. I’m turned around.

HARRY:
What just happened?

HERMIONE:
I don’t know.

LUNA:
Quibbler...? Quibbler	? 28	INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON28 LUNA LOVEGOOD moves down the aisle wearing a pair of RED and BLUE CARDBOARD GLASSES (SPECTRESPECS) identical to the ones modeled by a witch on the cover of the current issue of The Quibbler, a stack of which Luna clutches to her chest.

LUNA:
There’s an article on Wrackspurts this month. Quibbler...? The loitering STUDENTS ignore her, including DEAN THOMAS, currently WHISPERING to Ginny, who smiles mildly, more interested in the PURPLE PYGMY PUFF perched on her shoulder.

LUNA:
He’s lovely. They’ve been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?

GINNY:
Please. What’s a Wrackspurt?

LUNA:
They’re invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. (moving off) Quibbler? Quibbler?

HARRY:
Don’t you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.

HERMIONE:
Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --

HARRY:
It’s happened. He’s one of them.

RON:
You’re barking. What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?

HARRY:
So what’s he doing in Borgin and Burke’s? Browsing for furniture?

RON:
It’s a creepy shop. He’s a creepy bloke.

HARRY:
Look. His father’s a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides, Hermione saw it. With her own eyes.

HERMIONE:
I told you. I don’t know what I saw.

HARRY:
I need some air.

MALFOY:
What just happened? Blaise?

BLAISE:
(tense himself) Don’t know.

PANSY:
Relax, boys. The lights went out

MALFOY:
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I’d pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.

PANSY:
What’s that supposed to mean?

MALFOY:
Let’s just say I don’t think you’ll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.

MALFOY:
Amused, Blaise? We’ll see just who’s laughing in the end.

HERMIONE:
Where’s Harry?

RON:
Probably on the platform. C’mon.

MALFOY:
You two go on. I want to check something.

MALFOY:
Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! Malfoy wheels, points his wand at the luggage rack. Something hits the floor with a THUMP. The Invisibility Cloak slips away and reveals Harry, paralyzed on the floor. Malfoy grins.

MALFOY:
Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.

MALFOY:
Enjoy the ride back to London.

LUNA:
Wrackspurts. Your head’s full of them.

HARRY:
Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.

LUNA:
It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.

HARRY:
I am your friend, Luna.

LUNA:
That’s nice.

FLITWICK:
About time! I’ve been looking all over for you two. Names.

HARRY:
Professor Flitwick, you’ve known me for five years.

FLITWICK:
No exceptions, Potter.

LUNA:
Who are those people?

FLITWICK:
Aurors. For security.

MALFOY:
It’s a not a cane, you cretin. It’s a walking stick.

FILCH:
And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?

SNAPE:
It was his father’s.

MALFOY:
Is my father’s. He’s not dead. Snape watches Malfoy carefully wrap the stick in felt, lay it back inside his trunk.

SNAPE:
It’s alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

MALFOY:
Nice face, Potter.

LUNA:
Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way. But it’s up to you.

HARRY:
Have you ever fixed one? A nose.

HARRY:
What the hell. Give it a go.

HARRY:
Well? How do I look?

LUNA:
Exceptionally ordinary.

HARRY:
Brilliant.

RON:
Don’ you worry. He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff --

HERMIONE:
(whacking him) Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your best friend is missing!

RON:
Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.

GINNY:
He’s covered in blood again. Why is it he’s always covered in blood?

RON:
Looks like his own this time.

HERMIONE:
(as he arrives) Where’ve you been, Harry? And what happened to your face?

HARRY:
Later. What’ve I missed?

HARRY:
Thanks...

HERMIONE:
What’s happened to his hand?

DUMBLEDORE:
The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.

DUMBLEDORE:
Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master. Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape.

DUMBLEDORE:
Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight. You have a right to know why. (MORE)

DUMBLEDORE:
Today, of course, the world knows him by another name. Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact. Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle. But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.

DUMBLEDORE:
Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed. Pip pip!

RON:
(as they rise) That was cheerful.

HARRY:
This can’t be good.

HARRY:
Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor --

HARRY:
It is. Or was. But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. --

HARRY:
Really? Well... brilliant. I’ll head there straight away.

RON:
But I don’t want to take Potions!

SLUGHORN:
Harry m’boy! I was beginning to worry! And I see we’ve brought someone with us...

RON:
Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --

SLUGHORN:
Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine. Right then, books out --

HARRY:
Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got my book yet -- nor’s Ron. You see -- (until this morning...)	*

SLUGHORN:
Not to worry. You can get what you need from the cupboard.

SLUGHORN:
Now, as I was saying, I’ve prepared a few concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...?

HERMIONE:
Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that...

HERMIONE:
... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world. (MORE)

HERMIONE:
It’s rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --

SLUGHORN:
One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our year... Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook, looks up just as Slughorn’s eyes shift to him for confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously at him.

SLUGHORN:
Now Amortentia doesn’t create actual love, of course. That’s impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.

KATIE BELL:
Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in that one.

SLUGHORN:
Ah yes...

SLUGHORN:
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --

HERMIONE:
Liquid luck.

KATIE BELL:
But then why don’t people drink it all the time?

SLUGHORN:
Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.

BLAISE:
Have you ever taken it, sir?

SLUGHORN:
Twice. Once when I was twenty- four. Once when I was fifty- seven. Two tablespoons taken at breakfast. Two perfect days...

SLUGHORN:
So. This is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook.

SLUGHORN:
You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. In any event -- good luck.

HERMIONE:
How did you do that?

HARRY:
Crush it. Don’t cut it.

HERMIONE:
No. The instructions specifically say to cut.

SLUGHORN:
Merlin’s Beard! But it’s perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all! Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can’t you do, m’boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end...

SLUGHORN:
Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use it well.

DUMBLEDORE:
Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit.

DUMBLEDORE:
So. How are you?

HARRY:
Fine, sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
Enjoying your classes? Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.

HARRY:
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
And what of your activities outside the classroom? Do they bring you satisfaction?

HARRY:
Sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger. One can’t help but wonder if --

HARRY:
No! I mean... she’s brilliant. And we’re friends. But... no.

DUMBLEDORE:
Forgive me, Harry, I...

DUMBLEDORE:
... I was merely curious. (rising) In any event, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here.

DUMBLEDORE:
What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known then.	Tom Riddle.

DUMBLEDORE:
This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would...

DUMBLEDORE:
I am not family. But his name has been known to me since birth.

DUMBLEDORE:
Perhaps you could give me an example.

DUMBLEDORE:
How do you do, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE:
Don’t.

DUMBLEDORE:
As you wish.

TOM RIDDLE:
You’re the doctor, aren’t you?

DUMBLEDORE:
No. I am a Professor.

TOM RIDDLE:
I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff. They want me looked at. They think I’m different.

DUMBLEDORE:
Perhaps they’re right.

DUMBLEDORE:
It’s a school. A school of... magic.

DUMBLEDORE:
You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t.

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes.

DUMBLEDORE:
Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE:
(watching the spider) I can make things move -- without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me. I can make them hurt... if I want.

TOM RIDDLE:
Who are you?

DUMBLEDORE:
I’m like you, Tom. Different.

TOM RIDDLE:
Prove it.

DUMBLEDORE:
I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it. Open. It. Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and throws open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

DUMBLEDORE:
Take it out.

DUMBLEDORE:
Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?

DUMBLEDORE:
Why did you want these things, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE:
(looking off) I like having things that belonged to other people. It makes me feel ... close to them. Dumbledore studies Riddle’s profile, pondering this.

DUMBLEDORE:
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? (as Riddle nods) I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave your window open tonight. An owl will bring you a message. Read it carefully.

TOM RIDDLE:
I can speak to snakes too.

TOM RIDDLE:
They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal. For someone like me?

DUMBLEDORE:
It is unusual. But not unheard of.

HARRY:
Did you know, sir? Then?

DUMBLEDORE:
Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time? No. Had I...

DUMBLEDORE:
Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess which teacher that might be?

HARRY:
You didn’t bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
No. I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... (eyeing Harry knowingly) I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry. But I promise. In time you will know everything.

HARRY:
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.

DUMBLEDORE:
I did.

HARRY:
Do you want me to let him?

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes.

HARRY:
All right! Queue up! Excuse me...

GINNY:
SHUT IT! Instant silence. Harry frowns, nods to Ginny nevertheless.

HARRY:
Thanks. All right. This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths. But know this: Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?

CORMAC:
No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?

RON:
Hard feelings?

CORMAC:
I’ll be going out for Keeper as well. Nothing personal.

RON:
Really? Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --

CORMAC:
I like my chances. Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger? Wouldn’t mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?

HARRY:
All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s down to you two for Keeper. We’ll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac. Ginny, you’ll take on Ron.

CORMAC:
Hang on. She’s his sister. How do I know she won’t toss him a floater?

GINNY:
Piss off, Cormac. How ‘bout I toss you a floater?

HARRY:
Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my way. Now line up. On three. One. Two... Three! Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously while Cormac hovers in place, a confident sneer on his face.

HARRY:
(under his breath) C’mon, Ron...

LAVENDER BROWN:
Isn’t he brilliant?

RON:
Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormac’s not taking it too hard.

RON:
Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.

HERMIONE:
He’s vile.

HARRY:
Ever heard of this spell?

HERMIONE:
No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.

RON:
Not bloody likely. He’s top of the class. Even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he’s a genius.

RON:
What?

HERMIONE:
I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, shall we?

HARRY:
(holding it out of reach)

HERMIONE:
(suspicious) Why not?

HARRY:
It’s... old. The binding is fragile.

HERMIONE:
The binding is fragile? She makes another grab for it, but Harry holds it clear. Then Ginny appears, plucks it out of his hand.

GINNY:
Who’s the Half-Blood Prince?

GINNY:
That’s what it says. Right here. ‘This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.’

HERMIONE:
For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?

HARRY:
I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.

RON:
(a sarcastic chortle) Yeah. Right. (as Harry glares) Well, it’s true. I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now you’re always reading that bloody book. It’s like being with Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Well, I was curious. So I went to --

HARRY:
Good. That settles it then.

HAGRID:
Hey, you three!

HERMIONE:
What’ve you got there, Hagrid?

HAGRID:
Stinksap. Burn the whiskers right off yer chin. Trees ‘ere are drippin’ with it.

HERMIONE:
Stinksap? You’re not sick, are you?

HAGRID:
It’s not fer me. It’s fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh?

RON:
Spider? About six feet tall? Ten feet wide?

HAGRID:
Tha’s the one. He’s taken ill. I’m hopin’ ter nurse ‘im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.

RON:
Barking. Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?

HERMIONE:
The Aurors. I know they’re here to protect us, but... somehow I don’t feel any safer.

FLITWICK:
Emergency choir practice, I’m afraid, Horace.

HARRY:
No. Over here.

HARRY:
No, no. Sit next to me.

RON:
O-kay.

SKINNY KID:
What’ll we have?

HERMIONE:
Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please.

RON:
Aw, bloody hell...

HERMIONE:
Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re just holding hands... (MORE)

HERMIONE:
(as Dean kisses Ginny) And snogging.

RON:
I’d like to leave.

HERMIONE:
Leave? You can’t be serious.

RON:
That happens to be my sister.

HERMIONE:
So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? Would you expect her to get up and leave? Ron blinks, utterly speechless. Then:

SLUGHORN:
Harry, m’boy! Slughorn’s voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps -- and catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over, SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately -- an action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards him with amused curiosity.

HARRY:
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

HARRY:
So what brings you here, sir?

SLUGHORN:
Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back. Longer than I’d care to admit. In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick! As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as well. Slughorn’s belly trembles next to Hermione’s cheek and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table.

SLUGHORN:
Oops! All hands on deck, Granger!

SLUGHORN:
Listen, m’boy. In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two. Would you be game?

HARRY:
I’d consider it an honor, sir.

SLUGHORN:
You’d be welcome too, Granger.

HERMIONE:
Be delighted, sir.

SLUGHORN:
Brilliant. Look for my owl. (exiting, to Ron) Good to see you, Wallenby.

RON:
What’re you playing at?

HARRY:
Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.

RON:
Get to know him?

HARRY:
Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.

RON:
Um... You’ve got a little...

RON:
Bit worried about her. Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub? Her and me snogging. Ha. As if...

LEANNE:
Katie. You don’t know what it could be!

HERMIONE:
What’s up?

LEANNE:
I warned her! I warned her not to touch it!

RON:
Harry, she’s swallowing her tongue --

HERMIONE:
I’ll get someone --

HARRY:
There’s no time!

HAGRID:
Get back! All o’ yeh!

HAGRID:
Now, now. Now, now... Over and over he repeats this, soothingly, the words like a mantra, until Katie’s lids flutter and her body goes limp.

HAGRID:
Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the wrappin’s. Unnerstan’?

LEANNE:
It’s like I said. She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package. She said it was important she deliver it.

RON:
Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years.

SNAPE:
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

HARRY:
She was cursed, wasn’t she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly. If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn’t doing it knowingly.

HARRY:
It was Malfoy.

SNAPE:
Indeed. Your evidence?

HARRY:
I... just... know.

SNAPE:
You... just... know. Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.

RON:
What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny.

HARRY:
What does she see in him?

RON:
Dean? He’s brilliant.

HARRY:
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.

RON:
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn’t he? Something snaps. You’ve got to hate him. You know, on principle.

HARRY:
(troubled by this) I suppose.

RON:
So what is it? He sees in her?

HARRY:
I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive...

RON:
Attractive?

HARRY:
You know. She’s... got nice skin.

RON:
Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin?

HARRY:
Well, no. I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor.

RON:
Hermione’s got nice skin. Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I mean.

HARRY:
I’ve never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice.

HARRY:
I think I’ll be going to sleep now.

RON:
Right.

SLUGHORN:
A toast!

SLUGHORN:
To Hogwarts’ best and brightest!

CORMAC:
Here, here!

NEVILLE:
Which one do I use for the soup?

SLUGHORN:
So tell me, Cormac. See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

CORMAC:
Yes, sir. In fact, I’m meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday.

SLUGHORN:
Well, be sure to give them both my best. What about your uncle, Belby? Working on anything new? (to the others) For those of you who don’t know, Marcus’ uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

MARCUS BELBY:
Dunno. He and me dad don’t get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish. Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the -- (day.)	*

SLUGHORN:
And you, Miss Granger? What is it your family does in the Muggle world?

HERMIONE:
My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth.

SLUGHORN:
Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?

HERMIONE:
No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.

SLUGHORN:
Miss Weasley! Come in, come in.

GINNY:
Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late --

SLUGHORN:
No matter. You’ll be just in time for dessert. That is -- if Belby leaves you any.

HERMIONE:
Look at her eyes. They’ve been fighting again. Her and Dean.

SLUGHORN:
Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening. We’ll have to do it again.

SLUGHORN:
Oh. Potter.

HARRY:
Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.

SLUGHORN:
Ah, yes. A most intriguing object. The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation. When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not...

HARRY:
I think I’ll be going.

SLUGHORN:
Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, m’boy. As for some of your classmates, well, let’s just say, they’re unlikely to make the shelf.

HARRY:
The shelf, sir?

SLUGHORN:
Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. Then	* again... you are already someone aren’t you, Harry?

HARRY:
I don’t really know how to answer that, sir.

SLUGHORN:
Your mother was modest too. Your father not so much. As you can see, he did not make the shelf.

HARRY:
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

HARRY:
You knew him, didn’t you, sir? Tom Riddle. You were his teacher.

SLUGHORN:
Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.

HARRY:
What was he like?

HARRY:
I’m sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents, you see...

SLUGHORN:
Of course. It’s only natural that you should want to know more. I’m afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike the others I’ve known. In fact, not unlike... you. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.

NEVILLE:
Good luck, eh, Ron?

SEAMUS:
Counting on you, Ron. I’ve two Galleons on Gryffindor.

RON:
So. How was it?

HERMIONE:
Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

HERMIONE:
Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to bring someone...

RON:
I expect you’ll be going with McLaggen. Isn’t he a member of the Slug Club?

HERMIONE:
Actually, I was going to ask you.

RON:
Really?

HERMIONE:
Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --

LAVENDER BROWN:
(passing by) Good luck today, Ron! I know you’ll be brilliant!

RON:
I’m resigning. After today’s match. McLaggen can have my spot.

HARRY:
Have it your way. Juice?

RON:
Sure...

LUNA:
Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron.

LUNA:
Is that why you just put something in his cup. Is it a tonic?

HERMIONE:
Don’t drink that, Ron!

HERMIONE:
You could be expelled for that.

HARRY:
Dunno what you’re talking about.

RON:
C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to win.

GINNY:
What’s gotten into him?

DEAN:
Ginny! Let’s go!

CROWD:
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Harry takes his backslaps on the periphery, smiling as he sips a Butterbeer and enjoys Ron’s turn in the spotlight.

HERMIONE:
Ron seems to be enjoying himself.

HARRY:
Yep. Apparently it’s his lucky day.

HERMIONE:
You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.

HARRY:
Yeah. I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?

HERMIONE:
(caught) That was different. It was tryouts. This was an actual match --

HERMIONE:
You didn’t put it in? (as he shakes his head) Ron only thought you did?

HERMIONE:
Charms spell. Just practicing.

HARRY:
Ah. Well... they’re really good.

HERMIONE:
(studying her wand) How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? (off his look) I know, Harry. You’re my best friend. I see how you look at her.

LAVENDER BROWN:
Oops. I think this room’s taken.

RON:
What’s with the birds?

HERMIONE:
Oppugno! Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door.

HARRY:
It feels like this. 64	EXT. CASTLE - WINDOW - SAME TIME - NIGHT	64 THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione within. As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS. In the Common Room, the party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls Ron into a kiss. Figures pass by windows, including one tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR: Malfoy. As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow. 65	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY	65

RON:
Look, I can’t help it if she’s got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have -- well, let’s just say there was no stopping it. It’s chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is, I’m a free agent.

HERMIONE:
He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really couldn’t care less. Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn’s Christmas party together? Yes. Of course, now, given the circumstances, I’ve had to make other arrangements.

HERMIONE:
(stopping) Why didn’t I think of that?

HARRY:
So who are you taking?

HERMIONE:
(evasively) Um... it’s a surprise. Besides, it’s you we need to worry about. And you can’t pick just anyone. See that girl over there. That’s Romilda Vane. Rumor has it she’s trying to slip you a love potion.

HARRY:
Really...?

HERMIONE:
(snapping fingers) Hey! She’s only interested in you because she thinks you’re the Chosen One. You know that, right?

HARRY:
But I am the Chosen One. Hermione cocks her head at him, exasperated.

HARRY:
Okay. Kidding. I’ll just ask someone I like. Someone cool.

LUNA:
I’ve never been to this part of the castle. At least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see. It’s why I wear shoes to bed.

SLUGHORN:
Thank you, Adrian! (quietly to Harry) One of mine. Class of ‘78. I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. (suddenly) Oh my! Excuse me, Harry. I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation. Class of ‘67. (as he goes) Mingle, m’boy! Mingle! We’re all friends here. And we run the world.

VOICE:
Drink?

HARRY:
Neville...?

NEVILLE:
I didn’t make the cut for the Slug Club. It’s okay. He’s got Belby handing out towels in the loo.

ELDRED WORPLE:
Lovegood, did you say? I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing. Claimed to run a magazine...

HARRY:
What’re you doing?

HARRY:
And what’s happened to you?

HERMIONE:
Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the mistletoe.

HARRY:
Cormac! That’s who you invited!

HERMIONE:
I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he’s a menace. He’s got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.

WAITER:
Dragon tartar?

HERMIONE:
No thank you.

WAITER:
Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.

HERMIONE:
(grabbing the tray) On second thought -- maybe it’ll keep Cormac at bay. Oh no, here he comes!

HARRY:
I think she went to powder her nose.

CORMAC:
Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn’t she? Yak yak yak. What is this I’m eating, by the way?

HARRY:
Dragon balls.

SNAPE:
What’s going on back here?

SNAPE:
You’ve just bought yourself a month’s detention, McLaggen.

SNAPE:
Not so quick, Potter.

HARRY:
I think I should rejoin the party, sir. My date...

SNAPE:
... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. (MORE)

HARRY:
Traveling? Where?

MALFOY:
Take your hands off me, you filthy squib!

FILCH:
Professor Slughorn, sir! I’ve just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party.

MALFOY:
Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?

SNAPE:
I’ll escort him out.

MALFOY:
Certainly... Professor.

MALFOY:
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn’t. What’s it to you?

SNAPE:
I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow --

MALFOY:
I don’t need protection. I was chosen for this! Out of all others. Me! And I won’t fail him.

SNAPE:
You’re afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it’s obvious. Let me assist you --

MALFOY:
No! I was chosen. This is my moment! Malfoy exits. Then Snape.

RON:
Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure that’s what Snape said.

HARRY:
Positive. Why?

RON:
It’s just, well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow.

HARRY:
I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.

RON:
No, you don’t understand -- Oh, bloody hell...

HARRY:
I’ll take your word for it.

HARRY:
So what happens? If you break an Unbreakable Vow?

RON:
You die.

HARRY:
Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort. He’s been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.

LUPIN:
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?

HARRY:
I know it sounds mad --

LUPIN:
Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he’s up to?

HARRY:
That’s not what it sounded like.

TONKS:
Perhaps Harry’s right, Remus. To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --

LUPIN:
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgement. He trusts Snape. Therefore, I do.

HARRY:
But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself --

LUPIN:
You’re blinded by hatred.

HARRY:
I’m not --

LUPIN:
(sharply) You are! People are disappearing, Harry. Daily. We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we’re doomed.

GINNY:
Open up, you. Harry turns, finds Ginny, holding something in her fingers.

GINNY:
Don’t trust me?

HARRY:
It’s good.

GINNY:
‘Course ‘tis. Made them myself.

HARRY:
(studying him) Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?

HARRY:
(a nod, then) Did you get my owl?

HARRY:
Go on.

HARRY:
A Vanishing Cabinet?

HARRY:
What happened to it? The one at Borgin & Burkes?

TONKS:
It was delicious, Molly. Really.

TONKS:
No, we should go. (under her breath) The first night of the cycle is always the worst --

GINNY:
Everyone gone to bed?

HARRY:
Soon.

GINNY:
I don’t sleep these days. So I wash my hair. Silly, right?

GINNY:
Happy Christmas, Harry.

GINNY:
Oh my god... Harry turns, his BREATH FOGGING the WINDOWPANE as, far below, FLAMES SNAKE out of the reeds and SLITHER toward the house. Bellatrix emerges, peering up through the darkness toward Harry’s SILHOUETTE, a mad grin on her face. As she SHRIEKS EERILY, his eyes flash with hatred. 83	EXT. WEASLEY HOUSE - PORCH - SAME TIME - NIGHT	83 Harry bursts through the front door, wand drawn, pelts toward Bellatrix. She grins, turns, and vanishes into the reeds. MR. WEASLEY Harry, no! Flames race up the porch steps, climb the walls of the house. Lupin draws his wand and races after Harry.

TONKS:
Remus! Ron, Fred and George appear, join Arthur as he dashes toward the smoking marsh. Arthur glances back as Ginny emerges.

GINNY:
No, Harry! It’s a trap! Harry falters, looking toward Ginny’s voice and spies Greyback. Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks and, seeing Ginny, SHRIEKS with RAGE. Raising her wand, she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER of SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny fires back, then wheels away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face with...

GREYBACK:
Don’t you smell clean. Just then, a BOLT OF BLUE bursts off Greyback’s back and he turns, sees Harry standing several yards off. As Greyback gives chase, Ginny pelts after and we CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN Harry, Ginny and the beast between them, faster and faster, their BREATHS shortening until...

HERMIONE:
You’re lucky you weren’t killed.

HERMIONE:
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

HARRY:
(sharply) I know who I am, Hermione, alright? (frowning) Sorry.

HERMIONE:
So tell me what Arthur said.

HARRY:
If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.

HERMIONE:
What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?

HARRY:
You tell me.

HERMIONE:
He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill.

HARRY:
Who could tell the difference?

RON:
Lav, c’mon. Of course I’ll wear it.

LAVENDER BROWN:
That’s my Won-Won.

HERMIONE:
Excuse me, I have to go vomit.

TOM RIDDLE:
Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

SLUGHORN:
Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I? I must say, m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. (as the other boys laugh) By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you’re quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?

TOM RIDDLE:
Intuition.

SLUGHORN:
Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, don’t forget your essays...

SLUGHORN:
Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours...

TOM RIDDLE:
I know a secret shortcut or two.

SLUGHORN:
Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand.

SLUGHORN:
Go on.

TOM RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me...

DUMBLEDORE:
Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t.

HARRY:
I don’t understand -- what happened?

DUMBLEDORE:
This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s also a lie. (off Harry’s look) This memory has been tampered with. In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.

HARRY:
But why would he tamper with his own memory?

DUMBLEDORE:
I suspect he is ashamed of it.

DUMBLEDORE:
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done so. (MORE)

DUMBLEDORE:
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way you can.

HARRY:
I don’t know him that well, sir --

DUMBLEDORE:
You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins.

DUMBLEDORE:
This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail.

SLUGHORN:
Now don’t forget to look over the chapter on antidotes. I’ll be poisoning one of you next time we meet. I’m joking! Off you go! Don’t forget your rattails, Miss Alys.

SLUGHORN:
Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of Potions himself! To what do I owe the pleasure?

HARRY:
Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.

SLUGHORN:
Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!

HARRY:
Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading. Something about a bit of rare magic...

SLUGHORN:
Yes? And exactly what was this rare magic.

HARRY:
I’m not sure... That is, I don’t recall the name... exactly. But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach?

SLUGHORN:
I’m a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape.

HARRY:
Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is, he’s not like you. He might... misunderstand.

SLUGHORN:
There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light. I suggest you do the same.

HARRY:
Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir? When he came asking questions.

SLUGHORN:
Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn’t he? Didn’t he!

HERMIONE:
Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret? Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.

HERMIONE:
(rising to go)

HARRY:
Hermione. I think Malfoy’s leaving the castle.

HARRY:
I’ve seen it. Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.

HERMIONE:
That’s... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.

HARRY:
The Map is never wrong.

RON:
It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The moon.

HARRY:
Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?

RON:
It was on your bed. The box. Thought I’d try one...

HARRY:
Or twenty.

RON:
I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry.

HARRY:
Really? Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.

RON:
She could never annoy me. I think... I think I love her.

HARRY:
Excuse me?

HARRY:
Well... Brilliant.

RON:
Do you think she knows I exist?

HARRY:
Bloody well hope so. She’s been snogging you for three months.

RON:
Snogging? Who’re you talking about?

HARRY:
Who’re you talking about?

RON:
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

HARRY:
Okay. Very funny.

HARRY:
What the hell was that for?

RON:
It’s no joke! I’m in love with her!

HARRY:
Okay! Fine! You’re in love with her! Have you ever actually met her!

RON:
No. Can you introduce me?

HARRY:
Ron, these chocolates, they’re -- C’mon. I’m going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.

RON:
How do I look?

HARRY:
Devastatingly handsome. Harry RAPS on the door. FOOTSTEPS -- followed by a LOUD CRASH.

SLUGHORN:
Damn it all!

SLUGHORN:
Yes???!!!! (warily) Oh. Potter. It’s you. I’m afraid I’m busy at the moment --

HARRY:
Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t bother you if it weren’t absolutely --

RON:
Where’s Romilda?

SLUGHORN:
What’s the matter with Wenby?

SLUGHORN:
Ah. Very well. Bring him in.

SLUGHORN:
I’d have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you.

HARRY:
I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.

RON:
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

SLUGHORN:
Hm. Perhaps you’re right.

HARRY:
I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding.

SLUGHORN:
Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?

HARRY:
I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years. The questions. About... Voldemort.

SLUGHORN:
I’ll ask you not to use that name.

HARRY:
Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.

SLUGHORN:
With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived.

SLUGHORN:
Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up!

RON:
What’s this?

SLUGHORN:
A tonic for the nerves.

RON:
What happened to me?

HARRY:
Love potion.

SLUGHORN:
And a bloody strong one at that.

RON:
I feel really... bad.

SLUGHORN:
Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy. (eying Harry again) Do us all good, I think. I’ve got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...

SLUGHORN:
There we are, Potter. To life!

HARRY:
Ron! Ron!!! Professor, help him!

SLUGHORN:
I d-don’t understand --

HARRY:
Professor! Do something!! Slughorn shuffles haplessly through his bag, MUMBLING, at a loss. Harry turns back to Ron -- his skin is turning BLUE.

HARRY:
He’s choking!!

HARRY:
Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat. Breathe! BREATHE! Harry shakes him again and again... then stops. Ron’s head rolls limply from his fingers. Slughorn looks on, mouth agape. Useless. Then... A COUGH, a great hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and Ron is back. Breathing.

RON:
These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?

SLUGHORN:
Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud.

DUMBLEDORE:
Why indeed.

DUMBLEDORE:
This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.

SLUGHORN:
Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.

DUMBLEDORE:
To whom might I ask?

SLUGHORN:
You, Headmaster.

LAVENDER BROWN:
Where is he? Where’s my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? (stopping; glaring daggers) What’s she doing here?

HERMIONE:
I might ask you the same.

LAVENDER BROWN:
I happen to be his girlfriend.

HERMIONE:
I happen to be his... friend.

LAVENDER BROWN:
Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t spoken in weeks. I suppose you want to make up with him now that he’s suddenly all interesting.

HERMIONE:
He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve always found him interesting. Hermione frowns, a bit embarrassed. Ron SNORTS, stirring.

LAVENDER BROWN:
Ha! See? He senses my presence. I’m here, Won-Won. I’m here --

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended.

GINNY:
‘Bout time, don’t you think?

SLUGHORN:
I’ve always cherished my students. They’re my life...

HERMIONE:
Oh shut up.

HERMIONE:
Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow.

RON:
Huh?

HERMIONE:
Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don’t believe it was a long conversation --

RON:
Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It’s just she seems... a bit put out.

HERMIONE:
Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing?

RON:
Well... there is... something. (as Hermione hangs) But no. It can’t be. Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn’t I?

HERMIONE:
Right. Boggled...

HERMIONE:
That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell.

HARRY:
How are you, Katie?

KATIE BELL:
Give me a moment, girls.

MALFOY:
Don’t touch me! Don’t you dare touch me!

GINNY:
You have to get rid of it. Today.

GINNY:
Take my hand.

HARRY:
The Room of Requirement...

GINNY:
Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came. Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.

HARRY:
Who showed you this? First.

GINNY:
Fred and George. First year. I hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a time. Wish I’d left it...

GINNY:
See, you never know what you’ll find up here.

GINNY:
All right. Close your eyes. That way you can’t be tempted.

GINNY:
There’s something else. Another secret of sorts. One of mine...

GINNY:
That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.

RON:
So. Did you and Ginny do it?

RON:
You know. Hide the book.

HARRY:
Oh. Yeah.

RON:
Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?

HARRY:
Say that again.

HERMIONE:
Well? How do you feel?

HARRY:
Excellent. Really excellent.

HERMIONE:
Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.

HARRY:
Right. I’m going down to Hagrid’s.

HERMIONE:
What? No, Harry -- you’ve got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan --

HARRY:
No. I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s. I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, know what I mean?

SLUGHORN:
Merlin’s beard, Harry!

HARRY:
Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.

SLUGHORN:
Well, yes, actually -- (paranoid) Why would you think that?

HARRY:
Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they’re quite valuable, aren’t they?

SLUGHORN:
Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I’m familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all. My own interests are purely academic, of course.

HARRY:
Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.

SLUGHORN:
Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?

HARRY:
Through the front doors, sir. I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit. So if you don’t mind, I’ll be going.

HARRY:
Well, then by all means come along, sir.

SLUGHORN:
Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!

HARRY:
That would be counterproductive, sir.

SLUGHORN:
And what makes you say that?

HARRY:
No idea.

SLUGHORN:
Merlin’s beard...

SLUGHORN:
Is that an actual Acromantula?

HARRY:
A dead one, I think, sir.

HAGRID:
‘Arry. ‘Orace.

SLUGHORN:
My god, dear man. How did you ever manage to kill it?

HAGRID:
Kill ‘im! Me oldest friend, ‘e was!

SLUGHORN:
I’m sorry, I... 

HAGRID:
Ah, don’ worry yerself. Yer not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders. It’s the eyes, I reckon. Unnerve people.

HARRY:
Not to mention the pincers.

HAGRID:
I reckon that too... How’d yeh get outta the castle anyways?

HARRY:
Through the front doors.

SLUGHORN:
Hagrid. I wouldn’t want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn’t mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...

HAGRID:
Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any good, izzit?

SLUGHORN:
My thoughts exactly! Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions. Old Potion Master’s habit, you know...

HAGRID:
Wish yeh coulda seen ‘im in ‘is prime. Magnificent ‘e was. Jus’ magnificent...

SLUGHORN:
Why don’t I say a few words? I trust he had family?

HARRY:
Oh yeah.

SLUGHORN:
(clearing his throat) Farewell...

HAGRID:
Tha’ was... tha’ was... beautiful.

HAGRID:
I had ‘im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger’n a Pekinese.

SLUGHORN:
Sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he’d vanished. Poof.

HAGRID:
Tha’s odd.

SLUGHORN:
Isn’t it? That’s life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof.

SLUGHORN:
That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?

SLUGHORN:
But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?

HAGRID:
No idea... no idea at all...

SLUGHORN:
It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface. As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold. The petal had come from a lily.

SLUGHORN:
Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she...

SLUGHORN:
I know what you want. But I can’t give it to you. It will ruin me...

HARRY:
Do you know why I survived? The night I got this.

HARRY:
Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.

SLUGHORN:
Please don’t say his --

HARRY:
Professor. I’m going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at. It’s true. I am the Chosen One.

HARRY:
Only I can kill him. But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him.

HARRY:
Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.

SLUGHORN:
Don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. You don’t know what he was like... even then.

DUMBLEDORE:
How is he? Horace?

TOM RIDDLE:
Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

SLUGHORN:
Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I? I must say, m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. (as the other boys laugh) By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you’re quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?

SLUGHORN:
Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours...

TOM RIDDLE:
I know a secret shortcut or two.

SLUGHORN:
Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other Professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand.

SLUGHORN:
Go on.

TOM RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It’s called, as I understand it... a Horcrux. Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether.

SLUGHORN:
Excuse me?

TOM RIDDLE:
Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully understand it.

SLUGHORN:
I’m not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed.

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, sir. Which is why I came to you. I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.

TOM RIDDLE:
Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don’t understand how that works, sir.

SLUGHORN:
One splits one’s soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.

TOM RIDDLE:
How does one split his soul, sir?

SLUGHORN:
I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE:
Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number --

SLUGHORN:
Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... (MORE)

SLUGHORN:
(stopping; worried)

TOM RIDDLE:
Of course, sir. And I promise I’ll not speak of our conversation. It’ll be our little secret...

HARRY:
Sir --

DUMBLEDORE:
(haunted) This is beyond anything I imagined. In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific. I know now... you will see worse.

HARRY:
Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux?

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh he succeeded. And not just once. Think, Harry. He’s just told us.

HARRY:
Seven. He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number. But... what are they exactly?

DUMBLEDORE:
They can be anything. The most commonplace of objects. A ring, for example. Or a book...

HARRY:
Tom Riddle’s diary --

DUMBLEDORE:
It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this -- (holding up the diary) I knew. This was a different kind of magic. Very dark. Very powerful. But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...

HARRY:
And the ring...?

DUMBLEDORE:
Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and... (raising his damaged hand) ... even more difficult to destroy.

HARRY:
But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...	

DUMBLEDORE:
One destroys Voldemort.

HARRY:
But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t they...

DUMBLEDORE:
True. But magic, especially Dark magic...

DUMBLEDORE:
... leaves traces.

HARRY:
It’s where you’ve been going, isn’t it, sir? When you leave the school.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

DUMBLEDORE:
Once again, I shall ask too much of you.

HERMIONE:
Harry. It’s time.

HARRY:
Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?

HERMIONE:
If one wants it to be. Why?

HARRY:
It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.

HARRY:
He was going to the Room of Requirement.

HERMIONE:
Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!

RON:
No. I got an owl from Dad this morning. The one at Borgin & Burke’s? It’s still there.

HARRY:
But I’m telling you. I saw it -- Just then, the twins appear, pass. Harry watches them, a thought forming.

HARRY:
What if there are two? Vanishing cabinets.

HERMIONE:
What if there are?

HARRY:
I don’t know...

RON:
Good luck, mate.

HARRY:
I don’t need luck. I’ll be with Dumbledore.

SNAPE:
Have you ever considered that you ask too much? That you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don’t want to do this anymore?

DUMBLEDORE:
Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant. I will not negotiate this with you, Severus. You agreed. There’s nothing more to discuss.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry. You need a shave, my friend.

DUMBLEDORE:
At times I forget how much you’ve grown. At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. (smiling) Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I am an old man.

HARRY:
You look the same to me, sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. (MORE)

DUMBLEDORE:
A trait people never fail to undervalue. I’m afraid.

DUMBLEDORE:
The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry. I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise. But there is a condition: You must obey any command I give you -- without question.

DUMBLEDORE:
Should I tell you to run, you will run.

DUMBLEDORE:
And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...

DUMBLEDORE:
Your word, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
Being me has its privileges.

HARRY:
It’s there, isn’t it?

DUMBLEDORE:
This is the place. Oh yes, this place has known magic. (closing his eyes) Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...

DUMBLEDORE:
One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear. But this much is known: the children were damaged.

HARRY:
Sir! The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble, forming a narrow opening.

DUMBLEDORE:
In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.

HARRY:
You should’ve let me, sir.

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much more precious than mine.

DUMBLEDORE:
Careful. The water.

DUMBLEDORE:
It’s there. The only question is how do we get to it?

HARRY:
We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?

HARRY:
Accio Horcrux! There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of the water. Harry nearly sheds his skin. Dumbledore calmly watches it VANISH beneath the surface.

DUMBLEDORE:
Perhaps not.

DUMBLEDORE:
If you would, Harry...

HARRY:
Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?

DUMBLEDORE:
Only recreationally. You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck.

HARRY:
Professor... there are bodies in this lake.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes.

DUMBLEDORE:
Remember... the water.

HARRY:
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh yes.

DUMBLEDORE:
It has to be drunk. (as Harry reacts) You remember the condition on which I brought you with me?

DUMBLEDORE:
This potion might paralyze me. It might cause me to forget why I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests, Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood?

HARRY:
Why can’t I drink it, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. (taking the goblet) Your good health, Harry.

HARRY:
Professor? Can you hear me?

DUMBLEDORE:
Don’t... don’t make me...

HARRY:
You... you can’t stop, Professor. You’ve got to keep drinking. Like you said. Remember.

DUMBLEDORE:
Nooooooo!!!

DUMBLEDORE:
Make it stop... Please... make it stop...

HARRY:
It will, sir. It’ll stop. But only if you drink...

DUMBLEDORE:
My fault. It’s all my fault...

DUMBLEDORE:
Too much... I can’t... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!

HARRY:
What?

DUMBLEDORE:
Your word, Harry! Your word!

HARRY:
No...

DUMBLEDORE:
KILL ME! IT’S THE ONLY WAY! Harry stands paralyzed, unsure what to do. Then... Dumbledore collapses, rolls onto his back. Harry pelts forward, dips the goblet into the basin and kneels by Dumbledore.

HARRY:
One more. Just one more. And then -- I promise... I’ll do what you say.

HARRY:
I promise.

DUMBLEDORE:
Water.

HARRY:
You did it, sir. Look -- Harry frowns. The goblet is empty.

DUMBLEDORE:
Water! Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it to Dumbledore’s lips... but once again finds it empty. Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air.

HARRY:
I’m trying, sir. I’m --

DUMBLEDORE:
Go...

DUMBLEDORE:
We have to... go.

HARRY:
Don’t worry, sir. We’re nearly there.

DUMBLEDORE:
I am not worried, Harry. I am with you.

HARRY:
We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --

DUMBLEDORE:
No. Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened... (MORE)

DUMBLEDORE:
Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...

HARRY:
All right. Okay.

HARRY:
Sir, are you... praying?

DUMBLEDORE:
(smiling faintly) No, Harry. I do not pray. I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.

DUMBLEDORE:
Hide yourself below. And do not speak or show yourself without my permission. No matter what.

DUMBLEDORE:
Do as I say, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE:
Trust me. Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below, the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW.

DUMBLEDORE:
Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer?

DUMBLEDORE:
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?

DUMBLEDORE:
You are not an assassin, Draco.

MALFOY:
How do you know what I am? I’ve done things that would shock you.

DUMBLEDORE:
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison. Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I’m curious. When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?

MALFOY:
He trusts me! I was chosen!

DUMBLEDORE:
Then I shall make it easy for you.

DUMBLEDORE:
Well done, Draco. But I warn you.	 

DUMBLEDORE:
You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How?

MALFOY:
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.

DUMBLEDORE:
That cabinet has been broken for years.

MALFOY:
I’ve been mending it.

DUMBLEDORE:
Ingenious. Let me guess. It has a sister. A twin.

MALFOY:
In Borgin & Burkes. They form --

DUMBLEDORE:
A passage, yes. Very good. (eyes shifting) I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices. Let me help you, Draco.

MALFOY:
I don’t want your help! Don’t you see! I have to do it! I have to! (in a whisper) I’ve got to kill you or he’ll kill me.

DUMBLEDORE:
Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time.

BELLATRIX:
Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore. Wandless and alone. (MORE)

BELLATRIX:
Cornered in his own castle. Well done, Draco.

DUMBLEDORE:
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order.

BELLATRIX:
Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid we’re on a bit of a tight schedule. (to Malfoy) Do it.

GREYBACK:
He doesn’t have the stomach. Like his father. Let me finish him. In my own way.

BELLATRIX:
No! The Dark Lord was clear. The boy’s to do it. Go on, Draco. Now! Once again Draco raises his wand, his hand trembling. Harry’s own arm is stiff, sure. The vein in his hand pulsates...

SNAPE:
No.

DUMBLEDORE:
Severus...

BELLATRIX:
Well, look who’s here. Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Come to see the slaughter?

DUMBLEDORE:
Severus... please.

SNAPE:
Avada Kedavra! A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the ramparts, and then... the night swallows him.

SNAPE:
You can no longer stay here.

BELLATRIX:
Boo.

BELLATRIX:
Draco! Draco! (as he turns) They’ll kill you if you stay.

SNAPE:
Go on!

SNAPE:
Go on!

HARRY:
Cruciatus! Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.

HARRY:
Incacerata! Once again, Snape deflects the spell.

HARRY:
Impedimenta! Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated. Harry drops his arm in frustration.

HARRY:
Fight! Fight back, you coward!

SNAPE:
Don’t ever associate that word and my name again.

SNAPE:
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!

HARRY:
Sectumsempra! Bang! Snape wheels and once more sends Harry flying onto his back. Harry stares at the stars as they wheel over him, when Snape comes INTO VIEW.

SNAPE:
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?

SNAPE:
You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the Half-Blood Prince.

HARRY:
Hagrid... HAGRID!

HARRY:
Hagrid! You alright?

HAGRID:
Take more’n tha’ ter finish me off. Not sure about me ‘ouse, tho’. But if anybody can put it righ’, Dumbledore can.

HARRY:
Hagrid, Dumbledore --

HAGRID:
Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’ Snape was doin’ with tha’ lot.

HARRY:
No. He was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. And I did nothing...

HARRY:
Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not.
	 
HARRY:
Go on. Open it. 

HARRY:
Dunno. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which means, it was a waste. All of it.

HARRY:
I’m not coming back, Hermione.	

HERMIONE:
You don’t honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?	

HERMIONE:
Like that’s going to happen.			 

HERMIONE:
Besides, he’s barking.		
	 
HARRY:
Funny, he says the same about you.			 

HERMIONE:
Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive.			 

HARRY:
You’re brilliant. You both are.			 

HARRY:
I don’t know.	 

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1

SCRIMGEOUR:
These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong...

HERMIONE:
Coming, Mum.

TELEVISION:
... the bandicoot has small pointed ears and a long snout from which it emits a distinctive trumpet sound when agitated... MRS. GRANGER Darling, don’t be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company’s so clever... Hermione looks away from the screen, studies her mother and father. Slowly, she reaches into the tiny bag and withdraws her wand. Taking two steps forward, she points it toward the back of their heads. Hand trembling, she SPEAKS, her VOICE barely a WHISPER:

HERMIONE:
Obliviate. Mrs. Granger’s face goes briefly slack and she reaches out, as if to break a fall, then, slowly, her hand drops, coming to rest upon her husband’s. He blinks once, blankly, and then... enfolds her fingers in his. Hermione lowers her arm and, eyes stinging with tears, watches the PHOTOGRAPHS placed about the room begin to CHANGE. One by one, Hermione DISAPPEARS from each.

HERMIONE:
Goodbye. 5	
RON:
What are those?

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Close the door.

RADIO:
... comes to us this evening from the north of England, where a wizard family by the name of Westinburgh were found dead in their cellar. While not a member of the Order, Mr. Westinburgh and his wife had, on numerous occasions, provided shelter for its members... Arthur switches off the radio. Gestures to the others.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
These are for the Order. So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us. Know they’re not alone...

RON:
C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready.

VOLDEMORT:
Severus. I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way. Come. I’ve saved you a seat.

VOLDEMORT:
You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence. Are you, Lucius?

NARCISSA MALFOY:
My lord is always welcome here.

VOLDEMORT:
You bring news I trust, Severus?

SNAPE:
It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall.

VOLDEMORT:
And this information comes --

SNAPE:
-- from the source we discussed.

YAXLEY:
I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen.

SNAPE:
This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.

SQUAT MAN:
Well, they’ve got that right, then, ‘aven’t they?

VOLDEMORT:
Pius, what say you?

THICKNESSE:
One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear.

VOLDEMORT:
Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius. Where will he be taken? The boy?

SNAPE:
To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I’m told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him. As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety.

BELLATRIX:
My lord, if I might, I’d like to volunteer myself for this task. I’d like to kill the boy.

VOLDEMORT:
Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?

WORMTAIL:
Yes, m-my lord. Right away, my lord.

VOLDEMORT:
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter. But I face an unfortunate complication. It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter’s share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins. We can wound but not fatally harm one another. Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another’s wand.

VOLDEMORT:
Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What about... you, Lucius? Lucius peers up, sallow and beaten.

VOLDEMORT:
I require your wand.

VOLDEMORT:
Do I detect elm?

VOLDEMORT:
My wand? You can’t possibly think I would give you my wand. Lucius’ eyes meet Voldemort’s. For a moment he is speechless. Finally his chin drops.

LUCIUS:
No, my lord.

VOLDEMORT:
For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage’s belief that Muggles are not so different from us. (MORE)

VOLDEMORT:
She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged. I, of course, take a contrary view. But we’re all civilized here. All adults. We can agree to disagree.

CHARITY:
Severus, please. We’re friends...

VOLDEMORT:
Avada Kedavra!

VOLDEMORT:
Nagini... Dinner. 13	EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK	13 A blood-red sky hangs over the neighborhood. 14	INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - HARRY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - DUSK	14 An EYE shimmers in a SHARD of SILVERED GLASS. HARRY POTTER’S eye. He tosses the mirror inside a LUMPY RUCKSACK, than adds a LOCKET, a Daily Prophet CLIPPING entitled “Dumbledore Remembered” (above which is a PHOTOGRAPH of its author, ELPHIAS DOGE with DUMBLEDORE) and a NOTEBOOK filled with scribblings on Horcruxes and, in large block letters, the initials “R.A.B.” He gives the rucksack a shake, then glances about to see if he’s forgotten anything. The room looks as if it’s been bottled up and shaken. Dresser drawers turned out, floor covered in detritus.

UNCLE VERNON:
Come now, Dudley. Hurry up! Harry steps to the window, peers to the driveway below. UNCLE VERNON rolls a large STEAMER TRUNK towards his car, followed by DUDLEY, who tugs an equally large TRUNK of his own. Harry speaks to HEDWIG.

HARRY:
Time for the teary farewell. 15	INT. STAIRWELL/FRONT HALLWAY - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)	15 Harry drops down the stairs. The house feels barren, desolate. Aunt Petunia stands at the mouth of the kitchen, looking around. Seeing her, Harry comes to a stop.

AUNT PETUNIA:
I’ve lived in this house twenty years. And now -- in a single night -- I’m expected to leave.

HARRY:
They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth--

AUNT PETUNIA:
You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t know what they’re capable of?

AUNT PETUNIA:
You didn’t just lose a mother that night in Godric’s Hollow, you know. I lost a sister.

HARRY:
Do you have any? Magic?

AUNT PETUNIA:
What a cruel thing to ask.

UNCLE VERNON:
Well, this is goodbye then, boy.

DUDLEY:
I don’t understand. Isn’t he coming with us?

DUDLEY:
Why?

UNCLE VERNON:
Well, because -- he doesn’t want to, do you, boy?

HARRY:
Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right, Vernon?

UNCLE VERNON:
Come on, Dudley, we’re off.

DUDLEY:
I don’t think you’re a waste of space.

HARRY:
Well... thanks.

HARRY:
(under his breath) See you, Big D.

HARRY:
Good riddance.

HAGRID:
All righ’, ‘arry? Yeh look fit.

HARRY:
I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley.

SHACKLEBOLT:
You’re more important.

BILL:
Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.

FRED:
Wasn’t always this handsome.

FLEUR:
(a kiss to the cheek) You are still beautiful to me, William.

LUPIN:
Just remember, Fleur, once you’re married: Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

TONKS:
My husband, the joker. By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are --

HARRY:
The real one...?

HARRY:
No! Absolutely not!

HERMIONE:
(a sigh) I told you he’d take it well.

HARRY:
If you think I’m going to let people risk their lives for me --

RON:
Never done that before, have we?

HARRY:
This is different. Taking that. Becoming me -- no.

FRED:
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

GEORGE:
Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever.

MUNDUNGUS:
Technically, I’ve been coerced. (turning to Harry and extending his hand) Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I’ve always been a huge admirer.

HARRY:
Blimey, Hermione!

FRED:
Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?

FRED:
Just trying to defuse the tension.

GEORGE:
Don’t have something a bit more sporty, do you?

FRED:
Yes, don’t fancy this color at all.

FLEUR:
Bill, look away -- I’m ‘ideous.

RON:
(smirking) I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.

HERMIONE:
(wobbling a bit) Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

ALL:
Yes?

HARRY:
Here.

HAGRID:
Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ’ I should be the one ter take yeh away.

HARRY:
Hagrid! We’ve got to help the others!

HAGRID:
Can’t do it, ‘arry. My job’s ter get you where we’re goin’ safe ‘n sound -- Mad-Eye’s orders!

DEATH EATER:
That’s him! The real one!

HAGRID:
Hol’ tight, ‘arry! We’ve got ter get yeh out of here!

VOLDEMORT:
Avada... Abruptly, Harry’s arm rises as if on a string, drawn up by the wand trembling in his hand. GOLD FIRE spits forth and -- Crack! -- SPARKS skitter up the chassis of the motorbike. Harry wheels and -- for a split second -- is face to face with Voldemort, whose eyes drift, staring -- with something like fear -- at Harry’s wand. Then -- whoosh! -- Voldemort peels backward and away, evaporating like smoke. Just then...

HARRY:
Is no one back yet?

HAGRID:
They were on us from the star’, Molly -- the Death Eaters. And You-Know-Who as well.

HAGRID:
Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly? Fer medicinal purposes?

GINNY:
Ron and Tonks should’ve already been back. Dad and Fred as well.

GINNY:
Oh my God! George!

LUPIN:
The house! Quickly!

GINNY:
Remus! What’re you doing!

LUPIN:
What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!

HARRY:
Are you mad...?

LUPIN:
We’ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren’t an imposter.

HARRY:
Who did this to him?

LUPIN:
Snape. (nodding to George) He’ll be fine, Molly. But that’s Dark Magic. The damage is done.

HAGRID:
Someone else is back. 30	EXT. YARD (THE BURROW) - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER)	30 Hermione and Kingsley stand together, looking shaken. As the others rush forward, Kingsley points his wand at Lupin.

SHACKLEBOLT:
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?

LUPIN:
‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.’ Shacklebolt lowers his wand, wheels on Harry.

SHACKLEBOLT:
What gave you away?

HARRY:
Hedwig -- I think. She was trying to protect me --

RON:
Hey ya -- Well... thanks.

TONKS:
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. Wouldn’t be standing here without him.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Are we the last? Where’s George?

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Remus. Where’s my son?

FRED:
How do you feel, Georgie?

GEORGE:
Saint-like... You see, I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?

FRED:
With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey? Pathetic.

GEORGE:
Reckon I’m still better-looking than you. Better-looking than Bill, that’s for sure. Bill doesn’t smile. Next to him, Fleur looks equally grim.

BILL:
Mad-Eye’s dead. The room goes still.

BILL:
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.

LUPIN:
Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror. He knew he’d be in the most danger.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
It doesn’t explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight. The room grows quiet. Eyes shift.

HAGRID:
Wha’? One of us? Tha’s mad. I’d wager me life it wasn’ none of you lot. An’ if it was me I’d kno’, wouldn’ I? Talk in me sleep on occasion, I’ll admit, but there’s only Fang aroun’ ter hear an’ mostly it’s gibberish an’ besides I’d cut me tongue out ‘fore ‘d betray ‘arry e’en in me dreams -- Hagrid stops, blinking miserably. Suddenly, all smile.

HAGRID:
Wha’s so funny!

HARRY:
I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?

FRED:
Better. 32	OMITTED	32

VOLDEMORT:
You lied to me, Ollivander! 34	INT. MALFOY MANOR - CELLAR - NIGHT	34 At the bottom of a run of rotting wooden stairs, Wormtail props up an emaciated OLLIVANDER.

OLLIVANDER:
No! No! I believed a different wand would work, I swear!

VOLDEMONT:
Then explain this! Voldemort extends his skeletal fingers. Lucius Malfoy’s wand lies shattered upon his ghostly skin.

OLLIVANDER:
But it makes no sense...

VOLDEMORT:
Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail.

OLLIVANDER:
No! There must be a way! I’ll think of something else!

VOLDEMONT:
I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won’t be so forgiving next time...

RON:
Going somewhere?

HARRY:
No one else is going to die. Not for me.

RON:
For you? You think Madeye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

HARRY:
Come with me. Now.

RON:
And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without her. (MORE)

RON:
(glancing around) Don’t tell her I said that. (back to Harry) Besides, you’ve still got the Trace on you. And there’s the wedding...

HARRY:
I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes. It’s the only chance we have to beat him. And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.

RON:
Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor.

RON:
Do you think he knows?

RON:
I mean, they’re bits of his soul, the Horcruxes. Bits of him. When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle’s diary all those years ago -- he must’ve felt something right?

RON:
What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one...

RON:
Won’t he know he’s being hunted?

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
All together now! 36	EXT. WEASLEY HOUSE - ORCHARD - MORNING	36 Bird’s-eye view: An ENORMOUS CIRCLE of SILK lies flat upon the ground. As Hagrid looks on, Arthur, Bill, Ron and Fred stand on its periphery, wands poised.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
One. Two. Three! The silk rises, pitching itself into a perfect wedding marquee, trembling wondrously in the morning breeze... then collapses. 37	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (SECONDS LATER)	37 The DAILY PROPHET lies in f.g., HEADLINE SCREAMING: “DUMBLEDORE’S DARK SECRETS.” We HEAR FOOTSTEPS descend the stairs... then Harry’s blurry figure steps INTO FOCUS and takes the paper for a closer inspection. RITA SKEETER grins up at him, holding a BOOK entitled The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. A bit further down, another headline: “Think You Know Dumbledore? Think Again!”

GINNY:
Were you going to tell me?

HARRY:
Yes.

GINNY:
And Ron and Hermione. They’ll not be going back to Hogwarts either?

GINNY:
I see.

HARRY:
Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing. If I tell you, I’d be betraying him.

GINNY:
Zip me up, will you. She turns. The dress is open to the small of her back. Harry steps forward and takes the zipper. As the panels close, concealing her skin, his fingers linger at the top, lightly brushing the nape of her neck. They stand like this, utterly still, the moment fraught.

GINNY:
Seems silly, doesn’t it? A wedding. Given everything that’s going on.

HARRY:
Maybe that’s the best reason to have it. Because of everything that’s going on. Her chin turns, coming into profile, her face very close. Then she folds into him and they are kissing. Long. Deep. George wanders in brushing his teeth, pours himself a cup of tea and, sticking the toothbrush in his ear-hole, leans back against the stove for a sip. Ginny -- sensing something -- opens her eyes and JUMPS. Harry wheels. George winks, tips his cup in their direction.

GEORGE:
Morning. 38	EXT. ORCHARD - SAME TIME - MORNING	38 Arthur stands looking at the marquee from his POV: perfect.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
How’s it look on your end, boys?

FRED:
Brilliant! Just then, the silk snaps and the trees in the surrounding orchard shiver in a rush of wind. Everyone steps clear of the marquee and watches a TALL WIZARD with GRIZZLED HAIR and SCARRED CHEEK materialize. RUFUS SCRIMGEOUR.

GEORGE:
Bloody hell, what’s the Minister of Magic doing here?

RON:
Dunno. But something tells me he didn’t come to give away the bride.

HARRY:
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?

SCRIMGEOUR:
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.

HARRY:
And this would be...?

SCRIMGEOUR:
Don’t be coy, Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?

RON:
Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him. He was always polite --

SCRIMGEOUR:
And you, Miss Granger? How would you characterize your relationship?

HERMIONE:
We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --

HARRY:
What’s this all about?

SCRIMGEOUR:
This. Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will. Now why do you suppose that would be?

HARRY:
No idea.

SCRIMGEOUR:
Come now, you don’t expect me to believe...

SCRIMGEOUR:
‘Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.’ Scrimgeour removes a SMALL SILVER OBJECT from the bag.

RON:
Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it?

RON:
Wicked.

RON:
Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump... Harry and Hermione stare blankly at him.

RON:
Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...? Scrimgeour eyes Ron with mild annoyance, continues.

SCRIMGEOUR:
‘To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill. Scrimgeour places the tiny golden orb onto Harry’s palm, where it glimmers dully. Harry studies it, then looks up.

HARRY:
That’s it then?

SCRIMGEOUR:
Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The Sword of Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore’s to give away. As an important historical artifact, it belongs...

HERMIONE:
To Harry! It belongs to Harry! It chose him! It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!

HARRY:
Excuse me?

SCRIMGEOUR:
The sword is missing. (before Harry can pursue) I won’t pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter. But I assure you I’m not your enemy.

HARRY:
You’ll forgive me, Minister. But it’s a little hard to tell the difference these days.

SCRIMGEOUR:
Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke.

HERMIONE:
Where is your guard, sir?

SCRIMGEOUR:
I came alone. I don’t really need them anymore...

LUPIN:
We want you to be the godfather.

HARRY:
You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say.

LUPIN:
Say yes.

LUNA:
Hello, Harry! LUNA LOVEGOOD approaches in the company of a cross-eyed wizard (XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD) with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candy floss. Both wear robes the color of egg yolk.

LUNA:
Oh, I’ve interrupted a deep thought, haven’t I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

HARRY:
No, ‘course not. How are you, Luna?

LUNA:
Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. She holds up her finger, which is sheathed in blood.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!

HARRY:
Nice to meet you, sir.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully.

LUNA:
Come, Daddy. Harry doesn’t want to talk to us right now. He’s just too nice to say so.

HARRY:
Sir? May I sit down?

ELPHIAS DOGE:
Mr. Potter! By all means!

HARRY:
I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?

ELPHIAS DOGE:
I certainly knew him the longest, if you don’t count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.

HARRY:
I never even knew he had a brother, sir.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private. Even as a boy.

HARRY:
Sir, I was wondering if you’d had much contact with him before he died.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
The occasional owl. Though it was strange...

HARRY:
Could you tell me from where they’d come, sir?

ELPHIAS DOGE:
I’m afraid not. Albus’ messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys. They were surprisingly intimate. When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical. Still, I sensed he was under great stress. Why do you ask?

HARRY:
Just curious. I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that. I can also tell you that when a person passes, it’s only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me.

WOMAN:
Don’t despair, Elphias. I’m told he’s been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter. In 800 pages no less.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it.

MURIEL:
Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth. I read your obituary, Elphias. Lovely. But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore’s life.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
I’m sorry you think so, Muriel. I assure you I was writing from the heart.

MURIEL:
Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn’t made that mistake, I’m sure. Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well. You and I both know who that is, Elphias.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
A monstrous betrayal. I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.

HARRY:
Who are you talking about?

MURIEL:
Well, I don’t suppose it’ll be a secret once the book comes out. (relishing the moment) Bathilda Bagshot.

HARRY:
Who?

MURIEL:
Who? Bathilda Bagshot! My god, boy, she’s only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century. Don’t they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?

HARRY:
Oh, right. Slipped my mind...

MURIEL:
She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone. She’d have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two. I’m sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow to take a peek into that old bird’s rattled cage.

HARRY:
Godric’s Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?

MURIEL:
For years now. That’s where she first met Dumbledore.

HARRY:
Excuse me? You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?

MURIEL:
Of course. The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles. It was quite the scandal. (eyeing him) Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?

PATRONUS:
The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are coming... The lynx vanishes. A SCREAM shreds the silence. Then: chaos.

ELPHIAS DOGE:
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!

HERMIONE:
Ron! Ron! Harry turns, sees Hermione glancing about frantically. As she turns, Ron comes INTO VIEW, pushes toward her. Suddenly the canopy above turns to ribbons as DEATH EATERS -- in dark cloaks and masks -- descend into the crowd. Arthur, Fred and George wield their wands. Harry sees a flower fall from Fleur’s hair, watches it crushed underfoot, then catches sight of Ginny through the madness as she draws her own wand, copper hair gleaming, eyes flashing. He starts toward her, when... Lupin crashes in, spinning him roughly round.

LUPIN:
Harry! Go! Go! A HAND REACHES OUT AND GRABS HIS. He looks. It’s Hermione, clutching Ron’s hand with her other. She closes her eyes and a great WHOOSHING SOUND fills Harry’s ears. He takes one last desperate look at Ginny as he is thrown up and back in a WHIRLWIND and all goes BLACK. A HORN BLARES as... 41	EXT. SHAFTESBURY AVENUE (PICCADILLY) - NIGHT	41 ... a DOUBLE-DECKER BUS careens within inches of Harry, Ron and Hermione as they stumble INTO VIEW, the streets teeming with drunken pub crawlers.

RON:
Where are we?

HERMIONE:
Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why...

HERMIONE:
This way!

HERMIONE:
We need to change.

RON:
How the ruddy --

HERMIONE:
Undetectable Extension Charm.

RON:
You’re amazing, you are.

HERMIONE:
Always the tone of surprise.

HERMIONE:
That’ll be the books.

HARRY:
Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding? Maybe we should --

RON:
They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back.

HERMIONE:
Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please.

HERMIONE:
Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.

HARRY:
My rucksack. With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --

RON:
By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight.

HARRY:
DOWN! The tile EXPLODES on the wall where Ron’s head had been only seconds before. A rope of green light singes Hermione’s hair.

HARRY:
Stupefy! The JET of RED LIGHT hits the biggest Death Eater straight in the face and he crumples instantly.

HERMIONE:
Petrificus Totalus! He goes still. The Waitress steps from the backroom. Sees the trio. The wands. Her gum bubble... POPS.

HERMIONE:
Go.

HARRY:
Lock the door, get the lights. Hermione throws the bolt. Ron clicks the Deluminator, pitching the cafe into shadow. Harry eyes the unconscious Death Eater.

HARRY:
This one’s name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

RON:
This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters. Ron rolls him over with his foot. Dolohov’s eyes shift in fear from Harry to Hermione, then back to Ron.

RON:
So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t you? Ron’s face is hard. Hermione eyes him uneasily. He notices.

RON:
Suppose it’s him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then? Hermione looks at Dolohov. The moment hangs, then:

HARRY:
It’s better we wipe their memories. We kill them, they’ll know we were here.

RON:
You’re the boss. (turning to Hermione) Hermione?

RON:
You’re the best with spells.

HERMIONE:
Obliviate. There is a FLASH OF LIGHT and we --

HARRY:
How is it they knew we were there?

HERMIONE:
Maybe you still have the Trace on you.

RON:
Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law.

RON:
What?

HERMIONE:
We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...

HARRY:
Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...

HERMIONE:
Right. Perspective.

RON:
We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.

HARRY:
I have an idea. 45	EXT. 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)	45 A DOOR marked by the number 12. Harry TAPS his wand on the weathered surface and a series of METALLIC CLICKS are heard. The door swings open with a CREAK. 46	INT. ENTRYWAY (12 GRIMMAULD PLACE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION -	46

NIGHT:
The GAS LAMPS spring to life, illuminating a narrow cobwebbed hallway. The trio glance about, then Harry takes a step forward.

RON:
What was that about?

HERMIONE:
Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping.

HERMIONE:
Homenum revelio. Nothing. Hermione lowers her wand. Explains.

HERMIONE:
It’s a spell to reveal human presence.

HARRY:
Lumos. 50	INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING/CORRIDOR - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)	50 Harry’s wand BLOOMS in the darkness as he scales the stairs and reaches the landing. He peers into a bedroom. The drawers have been turned out. The bedsheets stripped. He moves on, painting the wall with wandlight, illuminating an EMPTY PORTRAIT of a MUDDY LANDSCAPE. He studies it -- long enough that we’ll remember it -- then a FLOORBOARD SQUEAKS -- like the night before. Harry wheels, points his wand down the dark corridor adjacent. 51	INT. DARK CORRIDOR - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)	51 Harry moves down the narrow corridor to its end, to a DOORWAY. He eyes the nameplate: “SIRIUS.” 52	INT. SIRIUS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION	52 We watch Harry enter from an UNSETTLINGLY LOW POV (Kreacher’s). This room, like the others, has been ransacked. Harry lingers by a PHOTOGRAPH. In it, FOUR YOUNG HOGWARTS STUDENTS -- JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK, PETER PETTIGREW and Lupin -- stand GRINNING before the WHOMPING WILLOW. Harry traces the thin cone of light of his wand across their faces. Books and papers carpet the floor. A WOMAN’S FACE, striking and wise, peers out from a dust jacket. Harry crouches, turns the book over to read its TITLE: A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot. Harry turns it BACK over, studies the woman's face again. He begins to rise when he notices a CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER embossed at the top with a name: Lily Potter. As Harry begins to read, we hear HER VOICE:

LETTER:
Dear Sirius. Thank you for Harry’s birthday present. You’d think he’d been born on a broom. (MORE)

LETTER:
James says he’s got the look of a Seeker, but then James would. We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry. Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn’t stay long. James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn’t have much choice. By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don’t know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore --

HERMIONE:
Harry! Harry!

HERMIONE:
Ron! I’ve found him!

RON:
Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!

HERMIONE:
Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought --

HERMIONE:
It’s from your Mum. To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?

HARRY:
Yeah. They knew her. She wrote A History of Magic, you know.

HERMIONE:
(with irony) Did she now?

HARRY:
I’m thinking maybe we should go talk to her. She still lives in Godric’s Hollow. I’m thinking maybe she could help us.

HERMIONE:
Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes.

RON:
Hey! I think you two better come down here.

RON:
The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure. Dunno ‘bout the bloke on the bench. (dropping the curtain) Can’t see us, of course. But we’ll have to be careful coming and going. C’mon. There’s something else you need to see.

HERMIONE:
Lovely.

HERMIONE:
Regulus Arcturus Black...?

RON:
R... A... B.

HARRY:
To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...

RON:
R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother?

HERMIONE:
Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

HARRY:
Stop! I order you!

RON:
Kreacher...

HARRY:
Been spying on us, have you?

KREACHER:
Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches.

HERMIONE:
Maybe he knows.

HARRY:
Ever seen this before? Kreacher GRUMBLES incoherently.

HARRY:
Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me. Which means I own you too.

KREACHER:
That was Master Regulus’ locket.

HARRY:
That’s right. But there were two, weren’t there?

HARRY:
Where’s the other one?

KREACHER:
Kreacher doesn’t know where the other locket is.

HERMIONE:
But was it here? Did you ever see it?

KREACHER:
Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you! Ron snatches Kreacher by the neck, shakes him.

KREACHER:
(gargling the words) Blood-traitor Weasley --

HERMIONE:
Ron! RON! Reluctantly, Ron releases the elf.

HARRY:
Answer her.

KREACHER:
Yes. It was here, in this house. A most evil object...

HARRY:
How do you mean?

KREACHER:
Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher. But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not..

HARRY:
Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?

KREACHER:
(nodding) He came in the night. He took many things, including the locket.

HARRY:
Who, Kreacher? Who was it?

KREACHER:
Mundungus. Mundungus Fletcher. The trio glance at one another, then Harry turns back to Kreacher, looks him in the eye.

HARRY:
Find him.

THICKNESSE:
As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this: You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide...

CORMAC:
My father will hear about this.

NEVILLE:
He’s not here, you fools.

HERMIONE:
They have flesh memories.

HERMIONE:
Snitches. They’re never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it. Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves. That way, if there’s a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it.

HARRY:
You mean... it remembers me?

HERMIONE:
(nodding) When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it.

DOBBY:
Harry Potter! So long it’s been -- Just then, a HAND -- Kreacher’s -- reaches out, grabs Dobby by the neck and pulls him away.

HERMIONE:
Expelliarmus! Mundungus’ wand soars into the air... into Hermione’s hand.

KREACHER:
As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!

DOBBY:
Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!

MUNDUNGUS:
What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin’ ‘ouse-elves on me!

DOBBY:
Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious. And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter’s name, which Dobby thought was very curious. And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very --

MUNDUNGUS:
I’m no thief, you foul little git. I’m a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --

RON:
You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

DOBBY:
Master Weasley! So good to see you again!

RON:
Wicked trainers.

MUNDUNGUS:
Listen, I panicked that night, all right? I never volunteered to die for you, mate. Can I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom --

HERMIONE:
Stop lying! Hermione begins to move toward Mundungus. Ron reaches out, takes her by the shoulders, eyes Mundungus warningly.

RON:
Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate?

HARRY:
When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?

MUNDUNGUS:
Why? Was it valuable?

HERMIONE:
You’ve still got it.

RON:
No. He’s worried he should have got more money for it.

MUNDUNGUS:
Wouldn’t be difficult, would it? Bleedin’ gave it away, din’ I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license. Says she’s of a mind to lock me up and would’ve, too, she hadn’ taken a fancy to that locket.

HARRY:
Who was she? This witch?

MUNDUNGUS:
Well, she’s right there, in’t she? Bleedin’ bow an’ all.

RON:
Right. So let’s do it. Who gets	* who?	*

HARRY:
This is completely mental.

HERMIONE:
Completely, utterly, without question.

RON:
The world’s mental. Come on,	* drink up. We’ve got a Horcrux to	* find.	*

SKINNY WIZARD:
Morning, Reg! Good luck today.

BALDING WIZARD:
Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me...

YAXLEY:
It’s still raining in my office. Two days now.

YAXLEY:
You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don’t you, Cattermole?

YAXLEY:
To interrogate your wife! If my wife’s blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I’d make it a priority. You’ve got one hour.

FEMALE:
Level Two. Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic Department. MAFALDA HOPKIRK/HERMIONE This is you.

FEMALE:
Level One. Minister of Magic and Support Staff...

UMBRIDGE:
Ah, Mafalda! Travers sent you, did he? Good. We’ll go straight down. (eying Harry) Albert, aren’t you getting out?

YOUNG WIZARD:
Weasley! Harry stops dead, peers around a corner and sees a slight, familiar-looking RED-HEADED WIZARD: PERCY WEASLEY.

YOUNG WIZARD:
They’re waiting for your report downstairs.

PERCY WEASLEY:
Oh, yes... of course. Harry watches Percy hurry off.

BESPECTACLED WIZARD:
Sh...careful. Pius Thicknesse appears, trailing a retinue of lackeys.

THICKNESSE:
Runcorn.

DOLORES UMBRIDGE:
HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION

BALDING WIZARD:
All right, all right. Let’s calm down, shall we?

BALDING WIZARD:
It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms. I think none of us will soon forget last month’s Poisonous Duck...

BALDING WIZARD:
R-Runcorn.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
I understand, Wakinda, but I can’t be a party to that.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Hello, Reg. Isn’t Mary in for questioning today? Try to have faith. If there’s anything Molly and I can do for you --

WAKINDA:
Let me guess. It’s raining in Yaxley’s office again?

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Tell him to try an umbrella.

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
Is that a threat, Runcorn?

SCARED MAN:
I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard! Look him up! William Alderton! He worked here for thirty years...

MARY CATTERMOLE:
Reg...

UMBRIDGE:
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

MARY CATTERMOLE:
Yes.

UMBRIDGE:
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred? Wife to Reginald?

MARY CATTERMOLE:
Yes.

UMBRIDGE:
A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. Is this that wand?

UMBRIDGE:
Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand.

MARY CATTERMOLE:
But I didn’t take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander’s, when I was eleven. It chose me. Umbridge leans forward, teeth glittering as the cat slinks by and briefly illuminates her face -- and the chain at her neck trembles like a snake, something heavy swinging forward and dangling over the void.

UMBRIDGE:
No, no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches. And you are not a witch.

MARY CATTERMOLE:
But I am! Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am!

UMBRIDGE:
What the devil are you doing, Albert?

HERMIONE:
Relashio! The chains encircling Mary Cattermole’s wrists drop like dead snakes. As she stands, she eyes Harry in amazement as he transforms back into himself.

MARY CATTERMOLE:
You? It’s you! Reg, it’s Harry Potter! REG CATTERMOLE/RON ‘Tis, isn’t it? This’ll be one to tell the kids. 86	INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - ATRIUM - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 86 As the trio, along with Mary Cattermole, pelts into the atrium and races toward the fireplaces, Harry bumps into the muttering wizard, who spins, takes a look at Harry, blinks.

MUTTERING WIZARD:
Harry Potter...? (louder) Harry Potter.

HERMIONE:
Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here.

REG CATTERMOLE:
MARY!

RON:
Long story. Nice meeting you.

RON:
Piss off.

YAXLEY:
Seal the exits! Now!

HERMIONE:
Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany.’

HERMIONE:
Quickly! Harry blinks, stumbles dizzily to the bag. As he reaches in, objects present themselves in furious succession.

HARRY:
Accio Dittany. A small BROWN BOTTLE lands in his palm.

HERMIONE:
Unstopper it.

HARRY:
Hermione. His arm --

HERMIONE:
Just do it!

HARRY:
What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.

HERMIONE:
We were. We were there. But Yaxley had hold of me. I knew we couldn’t stay once he’d seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched. I’m... sorry.

HARRY:
Don’t be stupid.

HERMIONE:
It’s all I feel safe doing.

HERMIONE:
Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...

HARRY:
What’re you doing?

HERMIONE:
Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...

HARRY:
Tent? Where am I supposed to find --

HERMIONE:
Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...

HERMIONE:
How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.

HARRY:
(under his breath) No problem.

HARRY:
How bad is he?

HERMIONE:
He’ll be alright in a few days. Hopefully. If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --

HERMIONE:
So where do we go next?

HARRY:
Dumbledore had a theory. He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects. And he felt they wouldn’t be hidden randomly either. We know of three so far. The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle’s grandfather. The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother.

HERMIONE:
It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol--

RON:
No, don’t! Don’t say it!

RON:
It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name. That’s how they track people now. It’s how they found us in the cafe that night.

HARRY:
How d’you know?

RON:
I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell?

HERMIONE:
(no longer confident) Dinner?

RON:
Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook.

HERMIONE:
Tea?

RON:
Is that it?

HARRY:
I know. I felt it too. (off Hermione’s look) It’s... it’s like it’s ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it’s --

RON:
... alive.

HERMIONE:
I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us.

HARRY:
That’s why we’re going to kill it.

HARRY:
Dissendium! The locket spins swiftly in place, but remains whole.

HERMIONE:
Incendio! Flames engulf the locket and its metal flesh turns scarlet, but then the flames die.

HARRY:
Expulso!

HERMIONE:
Confringo! The ground beneath the stump craters, but the locket remains untouched. Hermione lowers her wand, but Harry continues on, firing a succession of spells, looking almost possessed. Hermione studies him oddly until, finally, he stops. All goes silent except for the leaves shifting in wind above. Then, slowly, another sound comes clear... a TICKING. Coming from the locket.

RON:
It’s angry.

HERMIONE:
What’re you doing?

HARRY:
We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.

HERMIONE:
I can put it in my bag --

HARRY:
No.

RON:
Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother you?

VOLDEMORT:
Tell me, Gregorovitch. Tell me where it is... 93	INT. WANDSHOP - BACK ROOM - NIGHT	93 An OLD MAN (GREGOROVITCH) with pure-white hair and a bushy beard cowers in a dark corner.

GREGOROVITCH:
I told you! I no longer have it! It was stolen from me! Many years ago!

VOLDEMORT:
You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch? Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you... As a bony hand -- Voldemort’s -- extends a wand, Gregorovitch reacts with fear and we RUSH IN, DRIFTING THROUGH his dilating pupil INTO... 94	FLASHBACK - INT. DARK CORRIDOR - YEARS PAST	94 ... a hall of shadows. A younger Gregorovitch hurries toward a distant room, a lantern bobbing in his hand.

GREGOROVITCH:
I speak the truth! I remember like it was yesterday... 95	INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION	95 Gregorovitch bursts inside, lantern swaying. Wood shavings litter the floor.

VOLDEMORT:
Who was he? The thief?

GREGOROVITCH:
Just a boy! Not of the village. It was he who took it. I never saw it again. I swear on my life.

VOLDEMORT:
I believe you... A BURST OF GREEN LIGHT engulfs the room and...

HERMIONE:
I thought it had stopped. Harry looks at her, shakes his head.

HERMIONE:
You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have to close your mind. It’s too dangerous --

HARRY:
It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione. It always burns, even if it’s just a flicker. Can you understand that?

HERMIONE:
Tell me. What you saw.

HARRY:
He’s found him. Vol--

HARRY:
You-Know-Who. He’s found Gregorovitch --

HERMIONE:
The wandmaker?

HARRY:
Yes. How’d you know?

HERMIONE:
Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch. Most Durmstrang students did at one time. What’s he got to do with You-Know-Who?

HARRY:
You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what. But he’s desperate to have it. It’s as if his life depends on it.

HERMIONE:
Don’t -- It... comforts him.

HARRY:
Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news?

HERMIONE:
I think he just hopes he doesn’t hear bad news. It gets him through the day.

HARRY:
And what gets you through the day?

HERMIONE:
We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry.

HARRY:
How long before he can travel?

HERMIONE:
I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can.

HARRY:
You’re not doing enough.

HERMIONE:
Take it off.

HERMIONE:
Take it off. Now.

HERMIONE:
It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.

HERMIONE:
We’ll take turns. Okay?

RADIO:
... Severus Snape, newly appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts... As the signal fades, Harry rolls onto his side and twists the dial. Behind him, we see Hermione’s shadow RISE, move away from the tent...

RADIO:
... bears little resemblance to the school under Dumbledore’s leadership. Snape’s curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord and infractions are dealt with harshly by the two Death Eaters on the staff... Harry peers at the map before him and -- sure enough -- discovers Snape’s name drifting about Dumbledore’s office.

SCABIOR:
What’s that? That... smell? The others glance about dumbly. Scabior retraces his steps until he stands directly in front of Hermione, his eyes looking right through her. He leans forward ever-so- slightly, only inches from her neck, NOSTRILS FLARING. The locket TICKS, trembling upon Hermione’s breastbone. Then, slowly, Scabior pulls back, eyes probing the darkness, before withdrawing, leading the others away. The last pair drag what appear to be BODIES.

HARRY:
Snatchers.

HARRY:
Good to know your enchantments work. (CONTINUED)

HERMIONE:
He could smell it. My perfume.

HARRY:
We have to leave. We’re not safe here.

HERMIONE:
I told you. Ron’s not strong enough to Apparate.

HARRY:
Then we’ll go by foot.

RON:
I’m hungry.

HARRY:
We’re all hungry.

RON:
Leave it.

RON:
Mum can make food appear out of thin air.

HERMIONE:
(tenderly) No one can conjure food out of thin air. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law. The other four are --

RON:
(sharply) Oh, speak English, can’t you?

RON:
I said leave it.

HARRY:
It’ll be dark soon. We need to find a place to sleep.

HERMIONE:
Good plan.

RON:
Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep. Walk. Sleep.

HARRY:
My turn. As he reaches out, Ron blocks his hand. For a moment, they simply stand silently. Then Ron strips the chain from his neck, hands it to Harry and brushes past him. Harry glances at Hermione, drapes the Horcrux over his head and follows. Hermione watches them go, then does the same.

RON:
He doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he?

RON:
Wizards were here.

HERMIONE:
I don’t like this place.

HARRY:
Maybe you could tell me now.

HERMIONE:
Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made.

HARRY:
Brilliant.

HERMIONE:
You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

HARRY:
With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --

HERMIONE:
Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor. (MORE)

HARRY:
It only takes in that which makes it stronger...

HERMIONE:
Exactly! Which means...

HARRY:
... it can destroy Horcruxes.

HERMIONE:
Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.

HARRY:
You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

HERMIONE:
Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.

HARRY:
There’s only one problem... Suddenly the LIGHTS CLICK OFF...

RON:
The sword was stolen. The lights click back ON. Hermione and Harry turn, see Ron, Deluminator in hand, lying in the shadows of his bunk, staring at the roof as the FIRST DROPS OF RAIN hit the canvas above.

RON:
Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun. Harry glances at Hermione, who is studying Ron warily.

HARRY:
What’s the problem?

RON:
Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway.

HARRY:
Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.

RON:
All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down because now there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.

HERMIONE:
(quietly) Ron...

HARRY:
I thought you knew what you signed up for.

RON:
Yeah, I thought I did too.

HARRY:
I don’t understand. What part of this isn’t living up to your expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?

RON:
No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!

HARRY:
I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux!

RON:
Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren’t we!

HERMIONE:
Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day --

HARRY:
Yeah, he would. D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking?

HERMIONE:
Harry, we weren’t --

RON:
Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --

HERMIONE:
I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t!

RON:
Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or --

HARRY:
You think I don’t listen! You think I don’t know what it’s like --

RON:
NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!

HERMIONE:
Stop! Stop! They let go, step back. Harry points to Ron’s neck.

HARRY:
Go then. But leave that.

HERMIONE:
What? Ron, no -- please --

HERMIONE:
He’s gone.

HARRY:
Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...

HERMIONE:
It’s a Muggle station.

HARRY:
You were right. It’s like you said. Snitches have flesh memories. But I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost swallowed it.

HERMIONE:
‘I open at the close?’

HARRY:
What do you reckon it means?

HERMIONE:
I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well... She turns The Tales of Beedle the Bard into the flickering light, points to the top of the title page, to a SMALL DRAWING of a TRIANGULAR EYE.

HERMIONE:
I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is. It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book.

HARRY:
Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron- (catching himself) At Bill and Fleur’s wedding.

HERMIONE:
What d’you mean -- wearing it?

HARRY:
Around his neck. Like an amulet. I didn’t think much of it at the time. You know Luna -- she’s always got some mad thing or the other she’s carrying around. I just figured it ran in the family.

HERMIONE:
Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book?

HARRY:
Hermione, I’ve been thinking. I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow. It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died --

HERMIONE:
And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.

HARRY:
But it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who nearly died there. Wouldn’t that be just the kind of place he’d hide a Horcrux?

HERMIONE:
It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there. (off Harry’s look) The sword. If Dumbledore didn’t want it falling into the Ministry’s hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?

HARRY:
Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, ‘course it is. Obvious, isn’t it?

HERMIONE:
(eyeing him knowingly) Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?

HARRY:
Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might’ve popped open.

HARRY:
Hermione...

HERMIONE:
Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again.

HERMIONE:
I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion.

HARRY:
No. This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.

HERMIONE:
Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen...

HARRY:
Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad?

HERMIONE:
Yeah. I think they would.

HERMIONE:
Did you know he had a sister?

HERMIONE:
Lumos. Hermione plays the wand’s light over the surface of the stone, then stops. Though deeply worn by time, the symbol is unmistakable: the TRIANGULAR EYE. Hermione rakes the light over the name: IGNOTUS PEVERELL.

HERMIONE:
Ignotus... Hey, Har --

JAMES POTTER:
Born 27 March 1960 Died 31 October 1981

LILY POTTER:
Born 30 January 1960 Died 31 October 1981

HARRY:
Happy Christmas, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Happy Christmas, Harry.

HERMIONE:
Harry...

HERMIONE:
Someone’s watching us. By the gate.

HARRY:
C’mon.

HERMIONE:
I don’t think this is a good idea.

HARRY:
We look like ordinary Muggles.

HERMIONE:
Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.

HARRY:
Relax. This is right. I know it.

HERMIONE:
Omigod. Harry...

HARRY:
This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them.

HARRY:
You’re Bathilda, aren’t you?

HERMIONE:
Harry, I’m not sure about this.

HARRY:
Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she’s barely knee-high to a house-elf. I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly.

HERMIONE:
There’s something odd about her. And what’s that smell?

HARRY:
She’s gaga, remember?

HARRY:
Here. Let me do that.

HERMIONE:
You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot.

HARRY:
Miss Bagshot? Who is this man?

HARRY:
His name. Can you tell me his name?

HARRY:
This is him, Hermione. The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wandshop. The thief. Miss Bagshot, who is he?

HARRY:
She wants us to go upstairs.

HERMIONE:
All right...

HARRY:
She wants me to go. Alone.

HERMIONE:
Why?

HARRY:
It’s all right. You stay here.

HERMIONE:
Harry...

BATHILDA BAGSHOT:
(in Parseltongue) You are Potter?

HARRY:
(in Parseltongue) Yes.

BATHILDA BAGSHOT:
(in Parseltongue) I have something for you...

HERMIONE:
Harry! As Harry rolls onto his back, gasping for breath, Nagini’s massive body rolls over him, the Horcrux ticking feverishly against his chest. As Harry ROARS in pain, the lenses of his GLASSES fracture.

HERMIONE:
Confringo! As Hermione’s spell caroms off the trembling walls, we see both her and Harry reflected in a MIRROR. He leaps, sweeping her toward the smoldering window. As they pitch themselves into the night, the mirror EXPLODES and shards of glass, reflecting bits of Hermione and Harry and the giant snake, tumble in the night, slowly vanishing into... nothingness.

HERMIONE:
Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?

HARRY:
We got away.

HERMIONE:
I’m fine. But you’ve been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more... All stays DARK...

HARRY:
You’ve outdone yourself this time.

HERMIONE:
The Forest of Dean. I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago. It’s just how I remember it. The trees. The river. It’s like nothing’s changed. Not true, of course. Everything’s changed. If I brought my parents here, they wouldn’t recognize any of it. Not the trees. Not the river. Not... me.

HARRY:
Where are they?

HERMIONE:
Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia. They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily. No children.

HERMIONE:
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old.

HERMIONE:
You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. Well, I know.

HERMIONE:
It was in Bathilda’s sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn’t make for very nice reading --

HARRY:
Who is he, Hermione? The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?

HERMIONE:
Gellert Grindelwald. He’s not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who...

HARRY:
Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.

HERMIONE:
When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He’d started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn’t anymore. After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric’s Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.

HARRY:
Get to the hard part, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense. Dumbledore’s mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they’d never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level. They did a lot of talking that summer. But they always returned to one particular subject.

HERMIONE:
Wizard rule over Muggles.

HARRY:
And Dumbledore believed in it?

HERMIONE:
Yes.

HARRY:
‘For the Greater Good.’ What does that mean?

HERMIONE:
It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good. Grindelwald took a more violent position.

HERMIONE:
It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was young --

HARRY:
We’re young, Hermione. And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported.

HERMIONE:
He changed, Harry. Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison.

HARRY:
Where’s my wand? I’ll take the watch.

HARRY:
Hermione. Where’s my wand?

HERMIONE:
It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --

HARRY:
It’s done.

HERMIONE:
Maybe we can --

HARRY:
It’s done. His tone puts an end to it. She nods.

HARRY:
Leave me yours. You get back in the warm. And give me that.

HERMIONE:
He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you.

HARRY:
No...

HARRY:
Lumos! Hermione’s wand-tip ignites. Harry paints the clearing with light and something GLEAMS: a small FROZEN POOL. He crosses to it, looks down. He sees his own image reflected dully and then, deeper, within, a SILVER CROSS. He looks closer. It is the SWORD OF GRYFFINDOR. Harry steps back, blinks. It’s still there. He glances about, painting the trees with light, looking to insure he is alone, then casts light upon the pool once more.

HARRY:
Accio Sword. Nothing. Harry walks about the pool again and again and then stops. He crouches...

RON:
Are -- you -- mental? Harry’s eyes pop open. Standing a few yards away, fully dressed and half-drenched, clutching the sword of --

RON:
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think.

HARRY:
And the doe. That was you as well.

RON:
No. I reckoned it was you.

HARRY:
My Patronus is a stag.

RON:
Right. Antlers.

HARRY:
You didn’t see anyone else?

RON:
No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --

RON:
Anything?

HARRY:
(shaking his head) But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we’d find it.

RON:
And we did, didn’t we?

HARRY:
See that? It knows. It’s afraid. (looking up) Do it.

RON:
What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse.

HARRY:
All the more reason.

RON:
No. I can’t --

HARRY:
Then why are you here? Why did you come back?

HARRY:
I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don’t hesitate. I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me.

HARRY:
On three. One. Two. Three. (in Parseltongue) Take me inside... Click! The twin doors of the locket SNAP open. Behind each glass window a LIVING EYE blinks -- Tom Riddle’s eyes.

HARRY:
Stab it, Ron. Now.

VOICE:
I have seen your heart and it is mine...

VOICE:
I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears...

HARRY:
Ron. Don’t listen to it!

VOICE:
Least loved, by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved, by the girl who prefers your friend...

HARRY:
Ron. Stab it!

HARRY:
Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!

HARRY:
After you left, she cried for a week. She’s like my sister.

RON:
I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left.

HARRY:
You’ve sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.

RON:
Saving your life.

HARRY:
That too.

RON:
And just think of it. Only three to go.

HARRY:
Hermione!

HERMIONE:
Everything all right?

HARRY:
Fine. Actually... more than fine.

RON:
Hey.

RON:
Wo -- hey -- ouch!

HERMIONE:
(with each punch) You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley! You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, ‘Hey?’ (turning to Harry) Where’s my wand? Harry, where’s my wand! Harry places his hand over his pocket.

HARRY:
Um... I don’t know?

HERMIONE:
Harry Potter, you give me my wand!

RON:
How come he’s got your wand?

HERMIONE:
Never mind why he’s got my wand -- (stopping) What is that?

HERMIONE:
You destroyed it?

HERMIONE:
And exactly how is it you have the Sword of Gryffindor?

HARRY:
It’s a long story.

HERMIONE:
Don’t think this changes anything.

RON:
No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you! To see you doing those things --

HERMIONE:
See me doing what things?

HERMIONE:
What happened out there?

HARRY:
(at a loss, then) It’s a long story.

RON:
Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know how to find you.

HARRY:
Exactly how did you find us?

RON:
With this.

RON:
Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this.

HERMIONE:
And what may I ask did I say?

RON:
My name. Just my name. Like a whisper.

RON:
So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew.

HARRY:
Knew what?

RON:
Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here.

RON:
I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go. (MORE)

RON:
I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes.

RON:
How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me?

HARRY:
Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she’ll come round.

RON:
It was true. Every word. (a beat) You’re going to think I’m mental, but I think that’s why Dumbledore left it to me -- the Deluminator. I think he knew that at some point I’d... need to find my way back. And she’d lead me.

RON:
Bloody hell. I just realized. You need a wand, right?

HARRY:
Yeah...

RON:
Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back. (MORE)

HARRY:
Engorgio. The flames FLARE MASSIVELY and Ron leaps back.

HERMIONE:
What’s going on in there?

RON:
(to Harry) Maybe a bit more practice, eh?

HERMIONE:
We need to talk.

RON:
All right.

HERMIONE:
(ignoring him) I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.

HERMIONE:
It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow -- what?

HARRY:
Jesus. It was there too.

HERMIONE:
Where?

HARRY:
Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall...

RON:
But what does it mean? They all look down at the symbol etched in Dumbledore’s fine hand in the book.

HERMIONE:
Harry, you don’t have a clue where the next Horcrux is. And neither do I. But this, this means something. I’m sure of it.

RON:
I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it? Those in favor...

RON:
Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s Hermione and me this time.

HARRY:
Not still mad at him, are you?

HERMIONE:
I’m always mad at him.

RON:
Luna?

RON:
Keep off the dirigible plums.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
(to Hermione) What is it? (to Ron) Who are you? (to Harry) What do you want --

HARRY:
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I’m Harry Potter. We met a few months back?

HARRY:
Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir. I promise.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Excuse me.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
So. What brings you here, Mr. Potter?

HARRY:
Well, sir, we need some help.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Ah. Help. I see. Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days...

RON:
Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry?

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
I have expressed that view, yes. In the past. Would you excuse me one moment. I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you...

HARRY:
What’s going on here?

RON:
He’s mental. Let’s face it. Luna’s always good value, but she’s nutty as squirrel poo.

HERMIONE:
Do you see that?

RON:
Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it?

HERMIONE:
No! Don’t go near it!

HERMIONE:
It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material.

RON:
Yeah, all right...

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves.

HERMIONE:
Where is Luna, sir?

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Luna? Oh, um, she’ll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

HARRY:
Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding. A symbol...

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
You mean this?

HARRY:
Yes! Exactly. What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
What is it? Well, it’s the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
The Deathly Hallows. I assume you’re all familiar with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers?’

HERMIONE:
It’s in here.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Well, there’s no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale. Why don’t you read it aloud, Miss...?

HERMIONE:
Granger. Well... all right. (opening the book) There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --

RON:
Midnight. Mum always said midnight. (as Hermione glowers) But twilight’s fine. Better actually.

HERMIONE:
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass... As Hermione continues, Lovegood looks out the window. A CROW cycles INTO VIEW and we FOLLOW it, the sky DARKENING...

HERMIONE:
But being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

HERMIONE:
It was Death and he felt cheated, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He granted each brother a wish for their cleverness. The oldest, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence. So Death fashioned one from an elder tree on the banks of the river. All of this is dramatized in surreal silhouette.

HERMIONE:
The second brother, who was an arrogant man, asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death plucked a stone from the river. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would make him disappear. And so it was that Death handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. Death then stepped aside and the brothers went their separate ways... We see the brothers cross the bridge, and part.

HERMIONE:
The first brother traveled to a distant village where, with Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Proceeding to an Inn, he bragged of his invincibility. But that very night... We see a wizard, in shadow, slip into a room, KNIFE in hand.

HERMIONE:
... another wizard crept upon him as he lay sleeping. He took the Elder Wand... and slit the brother’s throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own... We see the second brother approach a cottage.

HERMIONE:
Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his home, where he took out the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother... We see Death etched upon a bleak hillside.

HERMIONE:
As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he had attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals... As Death and the third brother retreat, the crow returns, beating into the sky, which LIGHTENS, and we PULL BACK...

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Well, there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows.

HARRY:
Sorry... I still don’t really understand...

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
The Elder Wand...

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
The Resurrection Stone...

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows. Together... they make one master of Death.

HERMIONE:
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows? (to Harry and Ron) That was the name on the grave with the mark on it in Godric’s Hollow. Ignotus Peverell.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Ah, but your tea’s grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back.

RON:
(as Lovegood exits) Let’s get out of here once he’s back. I’m not touching this stuff, hot or cold.

HARRY:
(lost in thought) Which one would you choose if you could? Of the Deathly Hallows?

HERMIONE:
It’s obvious, isn’t it?

HERMIONE:
The Cloak.

RON:
You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand!

HERMIONE:
Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.

RON:
Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead.

HERMIONE:
(rolling her eyes) Why the Stone, Harry?

HARRY:
Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you? Mad-Eye. Dumbledore. Sirius. Anybody.

HERMIONE:
(gentle But according to the story they don’t want to come back. It’s all rubbish anyway. There’s no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.

HARRY:
But I have one. The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.

HERMIONE:
There have always been Cloaks --

RON:
Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry’s is different. It’s perfect.

HARRY:
And I think I’ve actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore’s office when he showed me the ring he’d destroyed, the Horcrux. It had a symbol on it. Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows.

HERMIONE:
Mr. Lovegood. Thank you, sir --

RON:
You forgot the water.

HERMIONE:
No matter, sir. We really ought to be go--

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
No, you mustn’t --

HARRY:
Sir?

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
You’re my only hope. They were angry, you see, about what I’d been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... (eyes finding Harry) But it’s really you they want...

HARRY:
Who took her, sir? Hermione eyes the printing press. A copy of the Quibbler lies stuck under a roller. She reaches out, pulls it free, the INK STREAKING over the cover, over HARRY’S FACE and the BLAZING HEADLINE: UNDESIRABLE NUMBER #1.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Him. Surely you call him You-Know- Who. But his real name of course is... Voldemort.

RON:
Nooooooooo! Instantly, out the window, FIGURES on BROOMSTICKS appear in the sky, jetting directly toward the house. As Harry, Ron and Hermione hit the floor, ROPES of LIGHT ricochet off the windowsill. The printing press EXPLODES, raining Quibblers everywhere, like a flock of doves, smoking with flames. Lovegood waves madly from the window.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD:
Stop! I’ve got him --

HERMIONE:
Ron! Harry! Take my hand!

RON:
That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust!

HARRY:
(softly) They’ve kidnapped Luna because he supported me. He was just desperate.

RON:
I’ll do the enchantments.

SCABIOR:
Hello, beautiful.

GRINDELWALD:
Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day. But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek... A SHADOW -- Voldemort’s -- falls across Grindelwald.

VOLDEMORT:
If not you, then who?

GRINDELWALD:
You’re so innocent, Tom. Like a schoolboy. There’s so much you don’t understand...

VOLDEMORT:
Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name!

GRINDELWALD:
Can’t you guess, Tom? It lies with him, of course. Buried within the earth. It is he who possesses it, even in death. Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore.

HARRY:
They exist. The Hallows.

HARRY:
But he only wants the one, the last one. That’s what he’s been looking for.

HERMIONE:
What’re you saying?

HARRY:
He knows where it is, You-Know- Who. He’ll have it by the end of the night. He’s found the Elder Wand.

RON:
Don’t touch her!

HERMIONE:
Stop it!

SCABIOR:
Your boyfriend’ll get worse than that if he doesn’t behave, lovely.

SCABIOR:
What happened to you, ugly?

SCABIOR:
What’s your name?

HARRY:
Dudely. Vernon Dudley.

SCABIOR:
Check the list. And you, ginger?

RON:
Stan Shunpike.

SCABIOR:
Like ‘ell you are. We know skinny Stan. Try again.

RON:
Weasley... (making it up) Barney Weasley.

SCABIOR:
Weasley, eh? Wouldn’t be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?

RON:
Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are!

SCABIOR:
Worth ten times you if I can find him. Wasn’t you that tipped him off, was it? Ron stays mute. Scabior turns to Hermione.

SCABIOR:
How ‘bout you, lovely? What do they call you...?

HERMIONE:
Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood. Scabior strokes the nape of Hermione’s neck, then takes her hair in hand, sniffs it.

SCABIOR:
You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you’re going to be my favorite.

SNATCHER:
There’s no Vernon Dudley on ‘ere. Reluctantly, Scabior turns from Hermione to Harry.

FENRIR GREYBACK:
Hear that, ugly? The list says you’re lying. How come you don’t want us to know who you are? Hm?

HARRY:
The list is wrong. I told you who I am --

SCABIOR:
Change of plans, boys. We won’t be taking this lot to the Ministry.

HARRY:
What did you put on me?

HERMIONE:
A Stinging Jinx.

HARRY:
How long will it last?

BELLATRIX:
Show me.

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2

HARRY:
What did you put on me?

HERMIONE:
A Stinging Jinx.

HARRY:
How long will it last?

HERMIONE:
Not long.

BELLATRIX:
Show me.

BELLATRIX:
Get Draco.

LUCIUS:
Why Draco?

BELLATRIX:
Just sit back and watch, Lucius. Hm? Pour yourself another glass of wine.

BELLATRIX:
Where’d you find them?

SCABIOR:
In the North Forest.

BELLATRIX:
Lovely scarf, Scabior. Though I’m not sure it’s your color.

BELLATRIX:
Fancy her, do you, Scabior? Can’t say I blame you. Maybe we’ll work out a little reward for you, hm? That is, assuming all is as it appears. Ah, Draco. Come here, darling.

BELLATRIX:
My friends here say they’ve got Harry Potter. Seeing as he’s an old school chum of yours, I thought you could confirm the fact for us.

LUCIUS:
Look close, Draco. If we’re the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven. Do you understand --

SCABIOR:
(quietly menacing) Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy?

BELLATRIX:
Of course not. (eyes hardening) Narcissa. Tend to your husband. Lucius staggers back nervously next to his wife.

BELLATRIX:
(to Draco) Don’t be shy, sweetheart. Get up nice and close.

DRACO:
What’s wrong with his face?

BELLATRIX:
What is wrong with his face, Scabior?

SCABIOR:
He came to us that way. I reckon he picked it up in the forest.

BELLATRIX:
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Bellatrix, eyes flashing, steps up close to Hermione.

BELLATRIX:
Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We’ll see what the last spell was.

BELLATRIX:
What is that?

BELLATRIX:
Where did you get that!

SNATCHER:
It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it’s mine now.

SCABIOR:
Are you mad!

SCABIOR:
How dare you! Release me, woman!

BELLATRIX:
Go. GO!

BELLATRIX:
Wormtail. Put these two in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one. Girl to girl.

RON:
Harry! What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone with her!

LUNA:
Ron? Harry...?

HARRY:
Luna...?

BELLATRIX:
This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?

HERMIONE:
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

BELLATRIX:
Liar. What else did you take?

LUNA:
You look strange, Harry. Mr. Ollivander, look who’s here. It’s Harry Potter.

BELLATRIX:
I’m going to ask you once again: what else did you and your friends take from my vault!

HERMIONE:
I told you. I don’t know what you’re talking --

RON:
We have to do something, Harry!

OLLIVANDER:
There’s no way out. We’ve tried everything.

LUNA:
You’re bleeding, Harry.

LUNA:
That’s a curious thing to hide in your sock.

LUNA:
You were hiding it, weren’t you?

HARRY:
Help us.

RON:
Let her go! Let her go!

WORMTAIL:
Shut it! You. Goblin. Come with me.

HARRY:
Dobby. What’re you doing here?

DOBBY:
Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course.

HARRY:
Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us with you?

DOBBY:
Of course. I’m an elf.

RON:
Works for me.

HARRY:
Right. Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander to --

RON:
Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. (as Harry looks at him) Trust me. Harry nods, turns to Luna.

HARRY:
You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander?

LUNA:
Of course. (to Dobby) Whenever you’re ready, sir. Dobby blinks at Luna’s use of “sir.” He GRINS.

DOBBY:
Like her very much. (to Ron and Harry) Meet me at the top of the stairs in ten seconds.

DOBBY:
Who gets his wand?

RON:
Sss.

NEW ANGLE:
As Harry joins Ron and looks:

BELLATRIX:
Well?

GRIPHOOK:
I left Gringotts employ many weeks ago, but when I was last in your vault, the sword was there.

BELLATRIX:
Perhaps it just walked out on its own then.

GRIPHOOK:
There is no place safer than Gringotts, Madam LeStrange.

BELLATRIX:
Liar! You can’t deceive me!

BELLATRIX:
Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same won’t be said for this one.

RON:
Like hell! Bellatrix wheels, sees Ron pelting forward.

RON:
Expelliarmus!

HARRY:
Stupefy!

BELLATRIX:
Stop or she dies!

BELLATRIX:
Drop your wands. Ron stands rigidly, staring balefully at Bellatrix.

BELLATRIX:
I said drop them!

RON:
(angrily) All right!

BELLATRIX:
Pick them up, Draco. Now! Well, well, look what we have here. Harry Potter. All bright, shiny and new again. Just in time for the Dark Lord.

BELLATRIX:
Call him, Draco.

HARRY:
Stupefy!

BELLATRIX:
You dirty little monkey! You could have killed me!

DOBBY:
Dobby meant only to maim or seriously injure, not kill.

BELLATRIX:
For God’s sake, Cissy, you’ve got a wand! Use it!

BELLATRIX:
How dare you take a witch’s wand. How dare you defy your masters.

DOBBY:
Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!

HARRY:
Give the Dark Lord our regards.

HARRY:
It’s all right, Hermione. You’re safe. We’re all safe.

HARRY:
It’s okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I’ll fix you -- Hermione -- your bag -- you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione! Help me!

DOBBY:
Such a beautiful night... to be with friends. Dobby is happy... to be with his friend... Harry Potter...

BILL:
Fleur’s seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending --

LUNA:
We should close his eyes. Don’t you think?

LUNA:
There. Now he could be sleeping. She turns then, looks at Harry.

LUNA:
Harry. It’s all right. That it hurts. That’s what reminds us how lucky we are to be alive.

HARRY:
I want to bury him properly. Without magic.

LUNA:
It’s beautiful here.

BILL:
It was our Aunt’s. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what’s left of us, at least.

LUNA:
Muggles think these keep evil away. But they’re wrong...

HARRY:
I need to talk to the goblin.

HARRY:
You probably don’t remember --

GRIPHOOK:
-- that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited Gringotts? Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter. (nodding to the window) You buried the elf. I saw you.

HARRY:
Yes.

GRIPHOOK:
And brought me here. Griphook studies him curiously.

GRIPHOOK:
You are a very unusual wizard.

HARRY:
Why did you leave Gringotts?

GRIPHOOK:
Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.

RON:
Then you’re on our side.

GRIPHOOK:
This is a wizard’s war. I take no side.

HARRY:
I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults.

GRIPHOOK:
It is impossible.

HARRY:
Alone, yes. With you, no.

GRIPHOOK:
How did you come by this sword?

HARRY:
It’s complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?

GRIPHOOK:
It’s complicated.

HARRY:
The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn’t steal it.

GRIPHOOK:
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange’s vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer.

HARRY:
And she never suspected?

GRIPHOOK:
The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

RON:
Who put it there? The fake.

GRIPHOOK:
It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.

HARRY:
And in Madam Lestrange’s vault as well?

GRIPHOOK:
I have no interest in gold.

HARRY:
Then what?

GRIPHOOK:
That is my price.

HARRY:
(a beat) All right.

GRIPHOOK:
I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?

HERMIONE:
Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault?

HARRY:
She was terrified when she thought we’d been in there. She kept asking you what else we’d taken. I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we’re one step closer to killing him.

RON:
And if we find one? How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given Griphook the sword?

HARRY:
I’m still working on that part.

OLLIVANDER:
Forgive me if I don’t get up.

HARRY:
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.

OLLIVANDER:
Anything, m’boy, anything.

HARRY:
Can you identify these, sir? Harry removes TWO WANDS. Ollivander takes one in hand.

OLLIVANDER:
Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.

OLLIVANDER:
Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

HARRY:
Was? Isn’t it still?

OLLIVANDER:
Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.

HARRY:
You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings. Can think.

OLLIVANDER:
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.

HARRY:
What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?

OLLIVANDER:
There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --

HARRY:
But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?

OLLIVANDER:
I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale --

HARRY:
You’re lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.

OLLIVANDER:
He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There’s no guarantee he will find it --

HARRY:
He has found it, sir. Ollivander blinks. Ashen. Stunned.

HARRY:
That’s all, sir. We’ll leave you to get some rest now.

OLLIVANDER:
He’s after you, Mr. Potter. If it’s true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I’m afraid you really don’t stand a chance.

HARRY:
Then I guess I’ll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.

RON:
You’re sure it’s hers?

HERMIONE:
Positive.

HARRY:
I reckon you should take this then.

HERMIONE:
Can’t I use the other?

RON:
You heard Ollivander. It’s Harry’s now.

HERMIONE:
But I hate that thing -- that’s the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...

HARRY:
If I can hold it, you can. Hermione looks him in the eye, then takes it.

RON:
How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.

HARRY:
I’ll know. I can’t explain. It’s like... (touching his chest) ... they sing to me. Hermione and Ron exchange a troubled glance.

RON:
That’s a bit scary.

HERMIONE:
It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --

HARRY:
No. I just know. When one’s near.

FLEUR:
This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
It’s perfect. Thank you, Fleur.

BILL:
You’re leaving, aren’t you.

HARRY:
In the morning.

BILL:
And Griphook?

HARRY:
He’ll be leaving too. Bill nods, staring off briefly. Then:

BILL:
Listen, I don’t know what you’re up to, but I know goblins. If you’ve struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don’t... he won’t be forgiving.

LUNA:
The sky has lost a star.

LUNA:
My father used to say that when a child died.

LUNA:
Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us.

HARRY:
Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don’t want you to think I --

LUNA:
I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That’s why we don’t need to talk about it.

HARRY:
Hogwarts? She nods, looks to the sea.

HARRY:
It’s not the place you left, you know. It’s not the same.

LUNA:
Neither am I.

RON:
Always good value. I’ll miss her.

RON:
What d’you think?

HARRY:
Wouldn’t know you if I didn’t know you.

RON:
You want to tell me what that is?

HARRY:
Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.

RON:
You mean he could see you?

HARRY:
Something like that. I don’t know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...

RON:
Go on.

HARRY:
You’ll think I’m mental, but more than once, when I’ve looked into it -- I think I’ve seen Dumbledore.

RON:
Bloody hell... that’s a sight.

BELLATRIX:
Well, how do I look?

RON:
Hideous.

BELLATRIX:
Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn’t I? Hold still...

RON:
Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --

RON:
Never mind. I’m good. (peering warily at her) That is you in there, isn’t it? Harry eyes Griphook, who is studying the sword.

HARRY:
You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?

WARLOCK:
Madam Lestrange.

BELLATRIX:
(cheerily) Good morning.

GRIPHOOK:
Good morning? Good morning? You’re Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!

RON:
Hey. Easy.

GRIPHOOK:
She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?

HERMIONE:
He’s right. I was being stupid.

HARRY:
C’mon. Let’s do it. A GUST of WIND BLOWS and we SHIFT TO a FADING POSTER of HARRY flapping on the brick wall, bearing the caption “UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE.” On the wall, in SHADOW, we see Griphook clamber onto Harry’s back. As Ron pitches the cloak over them... they vanish.

AGED GOBLIN:
Identification.

BELLATRIX:
I hardly think that will be necessary.

AGED GOBLIN:
(looking up) Madam Lestrange! Dear me! How may I help you today?

BELLATRIX:
I wish to enter my vault.

AGED GOBLIN:
I see. Very well. Excuse me, won’t you?

BELLATRIX:
I don’t like to be kept waiting.

TALL GOBLIN:
Next. Ron turns, sees the Tall Goblin eyeing him.

BELLATRIX:
He’s with me. (with utter disdain) As difficult as that may be to imagine.

GRIPHOOK:
They know!

RON:
What do you mean?

GRIPHOOK:
They know she’s an imposter! They’ve been warned!

BOGROD:
Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?

BELLATRIX:
And why should I do that?

RON:
Harry, what do we do? Harry...?

BOGROD:
It’s the bank’s policy. I’m sure you understand, given the current climate --

BELLATRIX:
No, I most certainly do not understand --

BOGROD:
I’m afraid I must insist.

HARRY:
Imperio.

BOGROD:
Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me.

AGED GOBLIN:
But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault.

BOGROD:
I’m fully aware of that. I’m also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.

AGED GOBLIN:
Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --

BOGROD:
Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I’ve run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!

BOGROD:
Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself. (to the guard) Teffington, see to that door, will you.

HARRY:
How long before they come after us?

GRIPHOOK:
Time will tell.

RON:
What’s that? Up ahead.

GRIPHOOK:
I should have known --

HARRY:
What is that, Griphook? The wheels SCREECH, throwing off SPARKS.

HARRY:
Griphook! What is that!

HARRY:
Well done. Hey. (studying her) You look like... you.

GRIPHOOK:
The Thief’s Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.

RON:
You don’t say. (as the cart’s alarms grow faint) Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?

GRIPHOOK:
No. Before the trio can savor this tidbit:

BOGROD:
What the devil are you all doing down here!

GRIPHOOK:
We need him!

BOGROD:
Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --

RON:
Imperio!

GRIPHOOK:
Well done.

RON:
No. It’s not possible...

RON:
Bloody hell. That’s a Welsh Green.

HERMIONE:
It looks like it’s been down here forever.

GRIPHOOK:
Go on.

RON:
It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.

HERMIONE:
That’s barbaric. I...

GRIPHOOK:
We’ll only have a few seconds. In other words... they’ll be no do- overs. Understood?

GRIPHOOK:
Ready, Bogrod?

BOGROD:
Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.

HERMIONE:
No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.

RON:
Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?

HERMIONE:
It’s hot!

GRIPHOOK:
They’ve added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch will burn and multiply!

HERMIONE:
Ron, your foot!

GRIPHOOK:
We’ll be crushed! Hurry!

HARRY:
That’s it. Up there.

HERMIONE:
How’re we going to reach it?

HARRY:
Give me the sword! The real one.

RON:
Keep going!

HERMIONE:
Harry! Behind you!

RON:
The cup!

HERMIONE:
In here!

HARRY:
We have a deal, Griphook. Griphook looks up. A kind of madness burns in his eyes.

GRIPHOOK:
I said I’d get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.

HARRY:
Griphook! Griphook!

GRIPHOOK:
Thieves! Help! Thieves!

RON:
Foul little git. Least we’ve got Bogrod.

RON:
That’s unfortunate.

HERMIONE:
We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea?

RON:
You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one.

HERMIONE:
I’ve got something. But it’s mad.

HERMIONE:
Relashio!

RON:
That’s your idea?

HARRY:
Come on!

HERMIONE:
It doesn’t realize it’s free! (trying out spells) Leviosa! Aviatus! Ex Cappa!

RON:
That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!

HARRY:
We’re dropping! The dragon circles, lower and lower. A lake shimmers.

LATE DAY:
204

VOLDEMORT:
The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.

VOLDEMORT:
(to Nagini) And you, my friend, must stay close...

HARRY:
(out of breath) You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts. He knows what we took. He knows we’re hunting Horcruxes.

HERMIONE:
How is it you --

HARRY:
I saw him.

HERMIONE:
You let him in! Harry, you can’t --

HARRY:
I can’t always help it, Hermione! (frowning) Maybe I can. I don’t know.

RON:
Never mind! What did you see?

HARRY:
He’s angry. But he’s scared too. He’s going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.

RON:
What happens when he finds out four are gone?

HARRY:
I reckon he’ll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There’s more: one of them’s at Hogwarts.

HERMIONE:
Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --

HARRY:
Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose.

RON:
‘Fraid he’s right. One problem: Snape’s Headmaster now. We can’t just walk in the front door.

HARRY:
We’ll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.

HARRY:
There’s something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected.

RON:
Maybe it’s because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he’s growing weaker. Maybe he’s dying.

HARRY:
No. It’s more like he’s wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.

HERMIONE:
They were ready for us. Suddenly BEAMS of LIGHT fracture the mist. DEATH EATER #1 (O.S.) We know you’re here, Potter. There’s no getting away.

RON:
What’s he mean by that?

HERMIONE:
No, you’ll give us away.

HARRY:
Expecto Patronum!

ABERFORTH:
In here, Potter.

RON:
Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was --

HERMIONE:
(mildly shaken by this) I know.

HERMIONE:
Harry! I can see you! In here!

ABERFORTH:
You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --

HARRY:
You’re Aberforth. The room goes quiet. The man turns, eyes Harry.

HARRY:
Dumbledore’s brother. It’s you I’ve been seeing -- here. It’s you who sent Dobby.

ABERFORTH:
Where’ve you left him?

HARRY:
He’s dead.

ABERFORTH:
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

HARRY:
How’d you come by it? Harry nods to the shard in Hermione’s hand.

ABERFORTH:
Mundungus Fletcher, ‘bout a year ago.

HARRY:
Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --

ABERFORTH:
Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you’d likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you’d be if I didn’t.

ABERFORTH:
Right then. Reckon you’re hungry. Let’s get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here.

HERMIONE:
Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?

ABERFORTH:
The Order is finished. You-Know- Who’s won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.

HARRY:
We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.	*

ABERFORTH:
Did he now? Nice job? Easy? An awkward silence, the tension heavy.	* HARRY	* We’ve been hunting Horcruxes. We	* think the last one’s in the	* school. But we’ll need your help	* getting in.	* (MORE)

ABERFORTH:
You know what to do... * The girl smiles, turns, and walks away, growing slowly * smaller in the painting with each step she takes.	*

HERMIONE:
Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.

HERMIONE:
Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it?

HERMIONE:
She’s coming back! And she’s got someone with her! * Just then, the painting BLOOMS FAINTLY and ARIANA emerges	* from deep within the dark canvas.	*

NEVILLE:
I knew you’d come! I told them all! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts! * HERMIONE	* (softly)	* Neville...	*

HARRY:
Neville, you look...

NEVILLE:
Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Hermione! Ron!

NEVILLE:
Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way.

RON:
I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map.

NEVILLE:
That’s because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.

HERMIONE:
How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster.

NEVILLE:
Hardly ever see him. It’s the Carrows you have to watch out for.

NEVILLE:
Brother and sister. They’re in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows.

HERMIONE:
They did that to you? But why?

NEVILLE:
Today’s Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed. The others look shocked. Neville grins.

NEVILLE:
Aw, c’mon. Don’t be grim. We’re all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C’mon, we’re almost there.

NEVILLE:
Let’s have a bit of fun, shall we? (pushing open the door) Hey! Listen up, you lot! I’ve brought you a surprise!

SEAMUS:
Not more of Aberforth’s cooking, I hope. Be a surprise if we could digest it.

SEAMUS:
Blimey.

NEVILLE:
Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry’s back.

NIGEL:
River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck...

NEVILLE:
Okay, okay! Stand down! Let’s not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance! (as they settle) Right then. What’s the plan, Harry?

HARRY:
Okay. There’s something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who.

HARRY:
I realize it’s not much to go on.

SEAMUS:
That’s nothing to go on.

HARRY:
I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas? He looks up. For a moment, there’s no response, then: LUNA Well, there’s Rowena Ravenclaw’s lost diadem.

RON:
(under his breath) Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.

LUNA:
The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn’t anyone ever heard of it? It’s quite famous.

CHO:
Yes, but Luna, it’s lost. For centuries now. There’s not a person alive today who’s seen it.

RON:
Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what’s a bloody diadem?

CHO:
It’s a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara.

CHO:
Ravenclaw’s was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer.

RON:
Six months she hasn’t seen me and it’s like I’m Frankie First Year. I mean, I’m only her brother.

SEAMUS:
Got loads of those, though, doesn’t she? There’s only one Harry.

RON:
Shut up, Seamus.

NEVILLE:
What is it, Ginny?

GINNY:
Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

ALECTO CARROW:
Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn’t want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?

SNAPE:
Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

SNAPE:
I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor.

SNAPE:
For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter’s return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle.

SNAPE:
Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter’s movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.

HARRY:
I think I can help you out with that...

HARRY:
It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.

HARRY:
And I’m afraid it’s rather extensive.

HARRY:
How dare you stand where he stood. Snape watches Harry draw his wand, point it at him.

HARRY:
Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!

HARRY:
I’m a Gryffindor. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL I thought it might have something to do with that. (turning to the room) All right! Settle down! Settle down!

VOLDEMORT:
I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is folly.

VOLDEMORT:
I wish you no harm. I have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shall be spilt...

VOLDEMORT:
Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.

PANSY PARKINSON:
But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!

FILCH:
Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!

FILCH:
Oh. Sorry, mum. Filch begins to turn away. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Wait! As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I’d like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall.

FILCH:
Right away. (stopping) Er, exactly where is it I’d be leadin’ em to, mum?

HARRY:
Time. As much as you can give me. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Do what you have to do. I’ll secure the castle.

HARRY:
Is that possible, Professor? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter. We’ve even been known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion.

HARRY:
I think you’re right.

HARRY:
You, too, Professor.

NEVILLE:
Let me get this straight, Professor. You’re giving us permission to do this?

NEVILLE:
To blow it up. Boom. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

SEAMUS:
I can bring ‘er down. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL That’s the spirit. Now off you go.

FLITWICK:
You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

MADAM SPROUT:
That doesn’t mean we can’t hold him up.

TEACHERS:
Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...

RON:
Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn’t really matter if we find the Horcrux.

HARRY:
(stopping) What’re you saying?

HERMIONE:
Unless we can destroy it.

RON:
So we were thinking --

HERMIONE:
You were thinking. It’s Ron’s idea. And it’s brilliant.

RON:
You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don’t we?

HARRY:
Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.

HERMIONE:
Where are you going?

HARRY:
Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.

LUNA:
Harry! Wait! I need to talk to you!

HARRY:
I’m a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.

LUNA:
But you won’t find anything where you’re going. You’re wasting your time.

HARRY:
We’ll talk later, Luna.

LUNA:
Harry --

HARRY:
Later.

LUNA:
HARRY POTTER! YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!

LUNA:
Don’t you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem: ‘There’s not a person alive who’s seen it.’

LUNA:
It’s obvious, isn’t it? We have to talk to someone who’s dead.

LUNA:
He’s very impressive, isn’t he?

VOLDEMORT:
They never learn. Such a pity. Voldemort smiles, as if amused. His eyes gleam fiercely.

THICKNESSE:
But, my Lord, shouldn’t we wait --

FRED:
Nice night for it! Harry turns to Luna.

HARRY:
Okay, Luna. Who’ve you got in mind?

SEAMUS:
That’s it. I want a charge on each and every joist.

NEVILLE:
You do know what you’re doing, don’t you, Seamus?

NEVILLE:
Not good.

LUNA:
If you’re to find her, you’ll find her down there.

HARRY:
Aren’t you coming?

LUNA:
No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She’s very shy.

KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT:
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.

DEAN:
Yes, sir.

KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT:
Dean! (as Dean stops) On second thought, tell Professor McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side.

LUPIN:
It’s the quality of one’s conviction that determines success, not the number of one’s followers.

LUPIN:
Speaking of quality.

LUPIN:
You shouldn’t have. It’s Teddy who needs you.

TONKS:
He’ll sleep ‘til dawn and snore like his father. It’s you who needs me tonight.

HARRY:
It’s you...

NEVILLE:
Ha! Ha!

NEVILLE:
Yeah! You and whose army!

SEAMUS:
Woah! Easy up there!

NEVILLE:
Sorry. (rubbing his elbow) Ow.

RON:
(in Parseltongue) Take me inside. Hermione’s eyes widen in shock. Ron shrugs.

RON:
Harry talks in his sleep. Haven’t you noticed?

HERMIONE:
No. Of course not. The hatch swings open.

RON:
I’ve never got this far before.

RON:
Me too.

HERMIONE:
I didn’t expect it to be like this.

RON:
What did you expect it to be like?

HERMIONE:
Not this.

HARRY:
You’re the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

THE GREY LADY:
I do not answer to that name.

HARRY:
I’m sorry. It’s Helena, isn’t it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena’s daughter. Luna told me.

THE GREY LADY:
Are you a friend of Luna’s?

HARRY:
Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.

THE GREY LADY:
You seek my mother’s diadem. Harry stops, stunned.

HARRY:
Yes! That’s right --

THE GREY LADY:
Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you.

HARRY:
Wait! Please!

THE GREY LADY:
Many have sought my mother’s diadem. Its powers are legendary...

HARRY:
But I don’t care about its powers! Honestly --

HARRY:
I don’t seek it for myself! You have to believe me!

HARRY:
I want to destroy it.

HARRY:
That’s what you want, isn’t it, Helena? You want it destroyed.

THE GREY LADY:
(vague, drifting) She thought I took it to hurt her. (MORE)

HARRY:
I’ll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I’ll destroy it, I swear, on my mother’s memory --

THE GREY LADY:
Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name...

THE GREY LADY:
I know what he’s done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!

HARRY:
Yes. That’s right. But I can undo that, Helena. I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You know where he hid it, don’t you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please. (stepping toward her) Trust me.

THE GREY LADY:
Strange... you remind me of him a bit...

THE GREY LADY:
It’s here. In the castle. In the place where everything is hidden...

THE GREY LADY:
If you have to ask, you’ll never know. If you know, you need only ask...

RON:
You do it.

RON:
Yes, you can.

NEVILLE:
Not good.

NEVILLE:
(to himself) Oh God --

SEAMUS:
He’s good...

SEAMUS:
He’s good... ... including the section under Neville’s feet... And he is gone. Ginny GASPS, hands to her face. Seamus frowns. The moment hangs. Seemingly forever.

NEVILLE:
(sarcastically) Well done, Seamus!

SEAMUS:
(grinning) Told yeh I’d bring ‘er down.

GINNY:
What?

NEVILLE:
That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head.

GINNY:
Mad. The both of you.

NEVILLE:
Not good.

FILCH:
Night-tee night.

PANSY PARKINSON:
You let us out of here, you filthy squib!

HARRY:
Ginny! Neville! You alright?

NEVILLE:
Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven’t seen Luna, have you?

GINNY:
I know. Then she is off, running, gone.

RON:
Bloody hell. We’ll never find him on this.

RON:
Brilliant.

HERMIONE:
He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:

RON:
He must’ve gone into the Room of Requirement. It doesn’t show on the map, remember? You said so last year.

HERMIONE:
(amazed he remembered) That’s right. I did.

RON:
Let’s go.

HERMIONE:
Brilliant.

DRACO:
Well, well, what brings you here, Potter?

HARRY:
I could ask you the same.

DRACO:
I virtually lived here last year. Remember?

HARRY:
What’s wrong with the one you have?

DRACO:
(studying it) It’s my mother’s. It’s very powerful, but it’s not the same. It doesn’t... understand me. (looking up) Know what I mean?

DRACO:
Easy.

HARRY:
Why didn’t you tell her? Draco doesn’t respond.

HARRY:
Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn’t say anything.

DRACO:
Give me my wand. Harry continues to study Draco’s face.

HARRY:
No. I don’t think so...

HARRY:
Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you’ll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me...

GOYLE:
C’mon, Draco. Don’t be a prat. Just do ’im.

GOYLE:
Avada Kedavra!

HARRY:
Expelliarmus!

HERMIONE:
Did you see where it went? The diadem!

HARRY:
It’s gone! We’ll never --

HARRY:
Well done. Let’s find Ron and get out of here.

RON:
RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire!

HARRY:
Split up!

HERMIONE:
Do we climb!

HARRY:
No, it’ll just follow us! Harry glances around once more and sees them: HALF A DOZEN ANCIENT BROOMSTICKS.

HARRY:
Here! Take one!

RON:
Serves him right.

HERMIONE:
C’mon! This way!

HARRY:
Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!

RON:
(to Hermioine) He’s joking, right?

RON:
IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!

RON:
Brilliant.

RON:
You’re bloody well welcome! (looking away) Prat.

HARRY:
Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.

HARRY:
He does.

HARRY:
It’s the snake. She’s the last one. The last Horcrux.

RON:
Where will he take her?

HERMIONE:
Someplace safe.

HARRY:
No. He’ll keep her close.

RON:
Look inside him, Harry. Hermione turns, looks at Ron. Then Harry does as well.

RON:
Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one step closer to ending this.

VOLDEMORT:
Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she’s just eaten.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn’t it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?

VOLDEMORT:
I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Of c-course, my Lord.

VOLDEMORT:
How do you live with yourself, Lucius? (eyeing him with disgust) Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.

HARRY:
I know where he is.

TRELAWNEY:
There’s more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.

NEVILLE:
Don’t mention it.

HERMIONE:
NO!

VOLDEMORT:
Why doesn’t it work for me?

SNAPE:
You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --

VOLDEMORT:
No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!

SNAPE:
There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only.

VOLDEMORT:
Does it?

VOLDEMORT:
You’re a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know.

VOLDEMORT:
Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?

SNAPE:
With you, of course, my Lord. Voldemort stares long at Snape, then, finally speaks:

VOLDEMORT:
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. (MORE)

VOLDEMORT:
But only I can live forever...

VOLDEMORT:
Kill.

VOLDEMORT:
Nagini! Come!

SNAPE:
Take them...

SNAPE:
Take them!

SNAPE:
Please.

HARRY:
Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.

SNAPE:
They are the same...

SNAPE:
You have your mother’s eyes... Snape’s face goes slack. Harry shivers. Ron reappears.

RON:
He’s gone. The snake too.

VOLDEMORT:
You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. (MORE)

RON:
Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!

HERMIONE:
Where is everyone?

PETUNIA EVANS:
Lily! Come out of there! Now!

PETUNIA EVANS:
We’re going home.

YOUNG SNAPE:
She’s jealous. Because she’s ordinary and you’re special.

YOUNG SNAPE:
It’s true. You know so yourself.

SNAPE:
No! Don’t kill me!

DUMBLEDORE:
That wasn’t my intention. Snape stares fearfully at him.

DUMBLEDORE:
Stand up, Severus. I haven’t much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?

SNAPE:
(rising) None. I come on my own account. I come with a... request.

DUMBLEDORE:
Is this about the Prophecy?

SNAPE:
Yes.

DUMBLEDORE:
How much did you relay?

SNAPE:
Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.

DUMBLEDORE:
The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --

SNAPE:
Yes! But he thinks it’s her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!

DUMBLEDORE:
If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.

SNAPE:
She’s more than that! She’s different! Beautiful. Kind. (looking away) Hide them all. I beg you.

DUMBLEDORE:
And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?

SNAPE:
Anything. The wind rises again, the TREES TREMBLING and...

SNAPE:
You said you would keep her safe!

DUMBLEDORE:
Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus.

DUMBLEDORE:
The boy survives. Snape’s eyes shift. Regard Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE:
He has her eyes.

SNAPE:
DON’T!

DUMBLEDORE:
If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then your way is clear.

SNAPE:
He doesn’t need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --

DUMBLEDORE:
The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.

SNAPE:
No one can know. Your word.

DUMBLEDORE:
My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.

SNAPE:
He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father’s. And he seems to relish his fame.

DUMBLEDORE:
Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.

SNAPE:
You see what you want to see. Severus walks on. Dumbledore smiles with amusement.

DUMBLEDORE:
Perhaps. Oh. Severus. (as he stops) Keep an eye on Professor Quirrell, won’t you?

SNAPE:
Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.

DUMBLEDORE:
I was... foolish... greedy...

SNAPE:
Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.

DUMBLEDORE:
For the time being?

SNAPE:
It will spread.

DUMBLEDORE:
Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort’s plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?

SNAPE:
It is not expected that he will succeed.

DUMBLEDORE:
But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn to... you.

DUMBLEDORE:
You must agree. Snape stares in horror at Dumbledore. Dumbledore nods.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

SNAPE:
You ask too much.

DUMBLEDORE:
(thundering) Too much! Nothing I could ask is too much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone!

DUMBLEDORE:
There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

SNAPE:
Tell him what?

DUMBLEDORE:
On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort’s soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself.

DUMBLEDORE:
There’s a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There’s a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort’s mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.

SNAPE:
So when the time comes, the boy must die.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.

SNAPE:
You’ve kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You’ve been raising him like a pig for slaughter.

DUMBLEDORE:
But this is touching, Severus. Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care for the boy?

SNAPE:
Expecto Patronum!

DUMBLEDORE:
Lily. After all this time?

SNAPE:
Always... We GO TO BLACK...

DUMBLEDORE:
The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...

HERMIONE:
Where’ve you been?

RON:
We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be --

HARRY:
I’m going there now.

RON:
Are you mad! No!

HARRY:
It’s... meant to be.

RON:
Rubbish! You can’t just give yourself up to him --

HERMIONE:
What is it, Harry? What is it you know?

HARRY:
There’s a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.

HARRY:
I think I’ve known for awhile. (studying her) I think you’ve known too. Hermione stands still, miserable.

HERMIONE:
I’ll go with you. I’ll --

HARRY:
Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it’s just him. Then it will be over.

OLIVER WOOD:
I’ll take him from here.

GINNY:
It’s all right. We’re going to get you inside.

YOUNG GIRL:
I kept calling. No one came.

GINNY:
Don’t worry. I won’t leave you. I promise.

HARRY:
(murmuring) Once. Twice. Thrice...

LILY POTTER:
You’ve been so brave, sweetheart.

HARRY:
Why are you here? All of you?

LILY POTTER:
We never left, dear.

HARRY:
Does it hurt? Dying?

SIRIUS BLACK:
Quicker than falling asleep.

LUPIN:
And he will want it to be quick.

JAMES POTTER:
You’re nearly there, son.

HARRY:
I’m sorry. I didn’t want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...

LUPIN:
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he’ll understand... A CHILL BREEZE shakes the trees. Harry looks ahead.

HARRY:
You’ll stay with me?

JAMES POTTER:
Until the end.

HARRY:
He won’t be able to see you? Sirius shakes his head, gestures to Harry’s heart.

SIRIUS BLACK:
No. We’re here, you see. Harry turns to his mother.

HARRY:
Stay close to me.

LILY POTTER:
Always...

YAXLEY:
No sign of him, my Lord. Voldemort nods, unmoving.

VOLDEMORT:
I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken.

HARRY:
You weren’t.

HAGRID:
HARRY! NO! WHAT’RE YEH DOIN’ ‘ERE!

YAXLEY:
Quiet!

VOLDEMORT:
Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die.

DUMBLEDORE:
You cannot help.

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.

HARRY:
Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren’t you, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh, yes.

HARRY:
Then... I’m dead too?

DUMBLEDORE:
Ah. That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole I think not.

HARRY:
But I didn’t defend myself. I let him kill me.

DUMBLEDORE:
And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, Harry.

HARRY:
It’s true, isn’t it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn’t it?

DUMBLEDORE:
Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.

DUMBLEDORE:
You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make.

HARRY:
And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die?

DUMBLEDORE:
Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess.

HARRY:
Professor, is that -- ?

DUMBLEDORE:
Something beyond either of our help.

HARRY:
Exactly where are we, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?

HARRY:
It looks like King’s Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.

DUMBLEDORE:
King’s Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.

HARRY:
Sir, why didn’t you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?

DUMBLEDORE:
You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn’t trust you.

DUMBLEDORE:
I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It’s clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man.

HARRY:
You wanted to see Ariana again, didn’t you, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes. Harry ponders this, then frowns.

HARRY:
I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...

DUMBLEDORE:
True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?

DUMBLEDORE:
(looking him in the eye) You are the true master of death, Harry, because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world.

HARRY:
I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?

DUMBLEDORE:
That is up to you.

HARRY:
I’ve got a choice?

DUMBLEDORE:
Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let’s say, board a train.

HARRY:
And where would it take me?

DUMBLEDORE:
True.

HARRY:
And the snake lives.

DUMBLEDORE:
Yes.

HARRY:
And I’ve nothing to kill it with.

DUMBLEDORE:
‘Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’

DUMBLEDORE:
I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would -- in this case -- amend my original statement to this: (leaning close) Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who most deserve it... (leaning back) Assuming circumstances in the main are favorable to such an outcome, of course.

HARRY:
With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle.

DUMBLEDORE:
I’ve never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.

HARRY:
Which would be, sir?

DUMBLEDORE:
Luck.

DUMBLEDORE:
Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.

HARRY:
Sir, my mother’s Patronus. It was a doe, wasn’t it? Just like Professor Snape’s. Curious, don’t you think?

DUMBLEDORE:
Actually, if I think about it... it doesn’t seem curious at all. (a smile) I’ll be going now, Harry.

HARRY:
Professor. As Dumbledore stops, Harry gestures vaguely.

HARRY:
Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?

DUMBLEDORE:
Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?

NARCISSA:
(in a whisper) Is he alive...?

BELLATRIX:
My lord, let me help you --

VOLDEMORT:
I do not require assistance.

BELLATRIX:
The boy. Is he dead?

NARCISSA:
Is he alive? Draco?

SORTING HAT:
Don’t despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason...

GINNY:
... Hagrid’s carrying?

GINNY:
Neville, who is that?

ARTHUR WEASLEY:
What’s going on here, Neville?

VOLDEMORT:
Behold, Nagini. Our work is done.

VOLDEMORT:
SILENCE! Voldemort points his wand to the sky with a CRACK.

VOLDEMORT:
Stupid girl. You cry for that?

VOLDEMORT:
(addressing all) Tell me. These last few hours -- as you collected the dead and tended your wounded -- was he by your side?

VOLDEMORT:
While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child’s.

VOLDEMORT:
So do not cry for that. He’s not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.

RON:
Liar!

VOLDEMORT:
Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!

VOLDEMORT:
Now is the time to declare yourself.

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Draco...

LUCIUS MALFOY:
Draco, don’t be stupid --

NARCISSA:
Come, Draco.

RON:
He saved your life.

VOLDEMORT:
Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don’t be shy.

VOLDEMORT:
Well, I must say, I’d hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?

VOLDEMORT:
Who might you be, young man?

NEVILLE:
Neville Longbottom.

VOLDEMORT:
Well, welcome, Neville. I’m sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.

BELLATRIX:
Someone has to do the washing. The Death Eaters ROAR.

VOLDEMORT:
Now, now, Bellatrix. Let’s not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day...

NEVILLE:
I’d like to say something.

HARRY:
... as his eyelids separate ever-so-slightly.

VOLDEMORT:
Very well, Neville. I’m sure we’d all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.

NEVILLE:
It doesn’t matter that Harry is gone.

SEAMUS:
(angrily) Stand down, Neville!

NEVILLE:
People die every day. Friends. Family. Yes, we lost Harry tonight. But he’s still with us, here -- (tapping his heart) And so is Fred and Remus and Tonks and... all of them. They didn’t die in vain. (turning to Bellatrix) But you will. (to a trio of Death Eaters) And you and you and you will. (to Voldemort) And so will you. Because you’re wrong. Harry’s heart did beat for us. All of us...

NEVILLE:
This isn’t over.

DRACO:
Potter!

RON:
Well done, Malfoy! (to himself) Can’t believe I just said that.

HARRY:
Confringo!

HARRY:
The snake! We’ve got to kill the snake!

NEVILLE:
Harry! Look out!

VOLDEMORT:
Nagini! With me!

VOLDEMORT:
Leave her!

VOLDEMORT:
I said LEAVE HER!

VOLDEMORT:
(in Parseltongue) Now, my sweet. Now.

VOLDEMORT:
Nagini!

VOLDEMORT:
Die! Die!

VOLDEMORT:
Why do you live!

HARRY:
Because I have something worth living for.

HARRY:
Confringo!

BELLATRIX:
Come on, granny, give us your best.

BELLATRIX:
Be thankful we only took one. Besides... (indicating George) It’s not like you don’t have a spare.

HERMIONE:
I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t about to be killed by a giant snake! It’ll just ruin it!

HARRY:
You were right.

HARRY:
When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.

VOLDEMORT:
It belongs to me! I killed Snape!

HARRY:
(taunting him) But what if the wand never belonged to him? What if the wand’s allegiance was to someone else?

HARRY:
Come on, Tom. Let’s end this the way we started it...

HARRY:
Together. And then he falls back, pulling them both...

OMITTED:
351

HERMIONE:
What’s the matter with her?

TRELAWNEY:
There’s more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.

HARRY:
I told you: it’s useless to you.

RON:
Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?

HERMIONE:
Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.

HERMIONE:
Something my mum used to say.

HERMIONE:
Why didn’t it work for him? The Elder wand.

HARRY:
Because it answers to another. Ron and Hermione study him.

HARRY:
When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.

HARRY:
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night... (looking up) ... when I disarmed Draco.

RON:
But that means... Harry nods.

HARRY:
It answers to me. Hermione stares at Harry. Ron stares at the wand.

RON:
What do you reckon we should do with it?

HARRY:
Well, it wasn’t boring, was it?

OLDER HARRY:
Together?

OLDER HERMIONE:
Don’t forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.

ALBUS:
Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?

OLDER HARRY:
There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the boats, remember?

ALBUS:
What if I’m put in Slytherin? Harry studies his son long and hard. Leans close.

OLDER HARRY:
Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.

ALBUS:
But just say I am --

OLDER HARRY:
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
